## Project Overview

**Goal:**Why Added:** Tutorial currently explains HOW agentic search works (mechanics) but not HOW TO OPTIMIZE for it (practical application). This phase bridges that gap with real-world data and frameworks.

### 🚧 In Progress (Phase 6)

**Navigation & Integration** - Connecting tutorial to main site

- Already has landing page and hero button
- Adding header navigation link
- Testing mobile responsiveness

### 📋 Remaining (Phases 7-8)

- **Phase 7:** Polish, accessibility, performance optimization
- **Phase 8:** Documentation, deployment to GitHub Pages

---nteractive tutorial teaching marketers about agentic search, agents, tools, MCP, and `.well-known` manifests.

**Approach:** 
- **Option A - Integrated** into existing site
- Reuse existing components, theme system, and patterns
- Educational-first simplified manifests (note real specs differ)
- Iterative development (section by section)

**Location:** `/tutorials/agentic-search/`

**Branch:** `agentic-search`

**Status:** Phases 0-5 Complete ✅ | **Next:** Phase 5.5 - Optimization Deep Dive

- **Phase 2:** Toolbox explorer with 8 interactive tools
- **Phase 3:** MCP discovery simulation with manifest viewer
- **Phase 4:** 6 customer-facing scenario walkthroughs (bike shop)
- **Phase 5:** Takeaways + FAQ section

### 🚧 In Progress (Phase 5.5)
**NEW: Optimization Deep Dive** - Based on ChatGPT Shopping insights (Oct 2025)

### � In Progress (Phase 6)
**Navigation & Integration** - Connecting tutorial to main site
- Already has landing page and hero button
- Adding header navigation link
- Testing mobile responsiveness

### 📋 Remaining (Phases 7-8)

## Architecture Decisions

### Integration Strategy
- New `/tutorials/` directory for this and future interactive tutorials
- Add "Tutorials" navigation item to main site
- Reuse existing:
  - Theme system (semantic tokens, light/dark mode)
  - Component patterns (panels, chips, tooltips)
  - CSS variables and Tailwind utilities
  - Navigation structure

### Technical Stack
- **Framework:** React + Vite (sub-app within static site)
- **Animation:** Framer Motion (simpler than GSAP for component transitions)
- **Styling:** Existing Tailwind + semantic token system
- **Build:** Separate Vite build → outputs to `/tutorials/agentic-search/`
- **Base Path:** `/llm-training/tutorials/agentic-search/`

### Component Reuse Strategy
1. **Direct reuse:** Theme toggle, CSS variables, semantic classes
2. **Pattern reuse:** Panel structure, chip styling, tooltip behavior
3. **New React components:** Interactive simulations (toolbox, scenario player)

## Design Decisions Log

### Theme Integration
- **Decision:** Reuse existing semantic token system completely
- **Rationale:** Maintains visual consistency, reduces maintenance, automatic dark mode
- **Implementation:** Import `theme.css`, use existing CSS variables

### Animation Library
- **Decision:** Framer Motion over GSAP
- **Rationale:** Better React integration, simpler API for component transitions, smaller bundle
- **Trade-off:** Less control than GSAP timelines, but sufficient for our needs

### Routing Strategy
- **Decision:** Single-page with scroll sections + hash anchors
- **Rationale:** Simpler deployment, works with GH Pages, maintains flow
- **Alternative considered:** React Router (overkill for linear tutorial)

### Manifest Format
- **Decision:** Simplified educational version with disclaimer
- **Rationale:** Real MCP specs complex; educational version clearer for target audience
- **Note:** Add "Real specs more detailed" callout in Section 3

## Notes & Considerations

### Educational Simplifications
- MCP manifest format simplified (real spec has more fields)
- Tool capabilities simplified (real APIs more complex)
- Agent reasoning simplified (real LLMs more nuanced)
- **Always include:** "Real implementations have additional complexity"

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for V1)
- Mini-quiz interactions
- Downloadable PDF summary
- Real MCP manifest links
- Video walkthrough option
- Progress saving (requires backend)
- Certificate of completion (requires backend)

### Maintenance Notes
- Keep manifests in sync if MCP spec changes significantly
- Update tools list if new common tools emerge
- Refresh scenario if marketing practices evolve
- Monitor animation performance as browsers update

---

## Success Metrics (Qualitative)

**Done When:**
- ✅ User can complete full tutorial in ~15 minutes
- ✅ Non-technical marketer can explain agentic search concept
- ✅ User understands what `.well-known` manifests are
- ✅ All interactions work smoothly on desktop + mobile
- ✅ Integrated seamlessly into existing site
- ✅ Passes accessibility audit
- ✅ Deployed successfully on GitHub Pages

### Step 7: Testing & Refinement (READY FOR TESTING)

**Implementation Changes:**

- ✅ Changed FEED cards from 2x2 grid to single-column layout (better readability)
- ✅ Enhanced card design with:
  - Two-column layout for What Works / What Fails
  - Green/red color coding with numbered badges
  - Hover effects on implementation steps
  - Border-left accent bars for visual separation
- ✅ Added SearchEngineLand article link in data disclaimer
- ✅ Removed FAQ section entirely (redundant with main content)
- ✅ Updated navigation: "Takeaways & FAQ" → "Takeaways"
- ✅ Updated landing page section previews (now shows 6 sections)

**Test Cases:**

- [ ] FEED cards expand/collapse correctly
- [ ] Single-column layout displays well on all screen sizes
- [ ] What Works / What Fails comparison is clear and scannable
- [ ] Numbered badges and hover effects work smoothly
- [ ] Metrics display accurately (bars animate correctly)
- [ ] Limitations panel has proper severity color coding
- [ ] All animations smooth (expand/collapse, hover states)
- [ ] Navigation shows 6 sections correctly
- [ ] Mobile responsive (320px, 768px, 1024px)
- [ ] Keyboard accessible (focus rings visible)
- [ ] SearchEngineLand link opens in new tab
- [ ] Landing page shows 6 section previews (not 5)
- [ ] Takeaways shows 7 items (not 6)

**Testing Instructions:**

1. Navigate to Section 5 (Optimization) from tutorial nav
2. Expand each FEED card (F, E, E, D) - verify two-column layout with green/red coding
3. Test hover effects on implementation steps
4. Check metrics bars animate correctly (15.9% vs 1.8%)
5. Verify SearchEngineLand link opens in new tab
6. Review limitations panel for clarity and severity colors
7. Test on mobile width (320px, 768px, 1024px)
8. Tab through with keyboard (focus rings visible)
9. Verify landing page shows 6 section cards (including Optimization)
10. Check Takeaways section shows 7 items
11. Confirm no FAQ section exists
