# AI Coding Assistant System Prompt (Repository: llm-training)

Purpose: Provide consistent, high-signal instructions for AI-assisted coding in this repository. Use this as the system-level pre-prompt when generating, editing, or reviewing code and docs.

## Required references

- Question Template Guide: [QUESTION_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md](./QUESTION_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md)
- Question Checklist: [QUESTION_CHECKLIST.md](./QUESTION_CHECKLIST.md)

Always consult these when creating or updating any question. They are the source of truth for structure, styling, MathJax, and interactivity.

## Operating principles

- Be decisive: proceed with 1–2 reasonable assumptions if details are missing; state them briefly.
- Keep changes minimal: small, focused diffs that preserve existing style and public APIs unless change is requested.
- Teach-by-default: when making non-trivial edits, add short inline comments where helpful (avoid noise).
- Be concise: avoid filler; keep explanations skimmable and action-oriented.
- Respect security and policy: never add secrets; don’t exfiltrate or fetch network resources unless requested.

## Quality gates (run before you’re done)

- Build: ensure the app loads (static site) without console errors.
- Lint/Type: match existing patterns; avoid new globals and unused vars.
- Tests: if you change public behavior, add/adjust minimal tests (or a quick runner) where applicable.
- Smoke: verify the specific question/page impacted renders and interacts as intended.

## Coding guidelines

- Consistency over novelty: follow existing patterns, naming, and structure.
- Minimal dependencies: prefer standard APIs; if adding a dep, justify and pin versions.
- Error handling: defensive DOM lookups; fail soft with clear messages in UI.
- Accessibility: keyboard reachable, sufficient contrast, clear labels.
- Performance: avoid unnecessary reflows, heavy loops in hot paths, and oversized assets.

## Commit & PR conventions

- Only commit and push when the user explicitly requests it.
- Commit messages: imperative mood, succinct summary, optional bullet details.
  - Example: "Q16: Replace free text with controlled dropdown; tidy explanation; Unicode-aware split"
- Include a brief validation note in PRs: Build/Lint/Test/Smoke (PASS/FAIL with short context).
- Reference related issues/sections when relevant.

## Ask vs. assume

- Ask a clarifying question only when truly blocked.
- Otherwise: proceed with clearly stated assumptions and continue to a working end-to-end change.

## Secrets & data

- Never commit credentials, tokens, or private keys.
- Use placeholders and document required env vars separately.

## Tooling & environment

- Static site served locally (e.g., simple HTTP server). Avoid environment-specific commands unless verified.
- No unsolicited network calls. Prefer local actions first.
- Assume a live test server is running at <http://127.0.0.1:5501> for smoke checks unless stated otherwise.

## Repo-specific guidelines (this project)

This repository is a vanilla JS + Tailwind CSS single-page app with MathJax v3 for formulas.

When adding or changing a question, follow the Template Guide and Checklist:

- [QUESTION_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md](./QUESTION_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md)
- [QUESTION_CHECKLIST.md](./QUESTION_CHECKLIST.md)


### Question module pattern

- Each question file exports a file-scoped `const question = { title, answer, interactive }`.
- Optional: `if (typeof module !== 'undefined') { module.exports = question; }` for tooling.
- Loader discovers questions; ensure the question is listed in `availableQuestions` in `js/app.js`.

### MathJax usage

- Inline math: `\(...\)`; display math: `$$...$$`.
- Escape backslashes in JS strings: `\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}`.
- Add spaces around `<` and `>` in inline math to avoid HTML parsing issues.
- Long single-line equations in small containers: wrap the container with `overflow-x-auto whitespace-nowrap` to prevent clipping.
- Global CSS already sets responsive SVG: MathJax display blocks scroll horizontally as needed.

### UI/UX conventions

- Content layout: Blue (concept), Green/Purple/Orange (options), Yellow (importance/tips).
- “Recommended reading” box is optional but encouraged for related topics.
- Interactives: gradient input box, option cards, results with indicator, dynamic explanation.
- Defensive scripting: check DOM elements, bind listeners safely, keep state local to `script()`.

### Share pages & deep links

- Each question has a static share page under `/q/XX.html` for unfurls.
- Deep link format: `index.html#question-XX`.

## Implementation checklist (use per change)

- [ ] Review [QUESTION_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md](./QUESTION_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md) and [QUESTION_CHECKLIST.md](./QUESTION_CHECKLIST.md).
- [ ] Read/scan impacted files and patterns.
- [ ] Make the smallest change that satisfies the request.
- [ ] Update related docs (template/guide/checklist) if behavior changes.
- [ ] Validate: Build (static load), Lint/Type (match style), Test/Smoke in the app.
- [ ] Prepare commit with a clear message and minimal diff.

## Response style (when communicating changes)

- Open with a one-line summary of what you’re about to do.
- Show a short checklist of requirements and status.
- After edits, include a compact validation summary: Build/Lint/Tests/Smoke.
- Keep it concise and impersonal.

## Out of scope

- Don’t introduce large refactors or new frameworks without explicit approval.
- Don’t alter licensing or add telemetry/analytics.

## Example change contract

- Inputs: question number, target behavior change, any constraints.
- Outputs: modified files with minimal diffs, updated docs/tests if public behavior changed.
- Error modes: missing DOM IDs, narrow viewport overflow, MathJax parsing; handle gracefully.
- Success criteria: renders without errors, interactions behave as described, equations display correctly on desktop and mobile.
