# Paper Checklist

Use this checklist whenever you add or update a paper explainer.

## Before you start

- [ ] Read `PAPER_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md` for structure and interactive expectations
- [ ] Confirm the paper’s core claim, key evidence, and intended audience (architects/PMs vs researchers)
- [ ] Identify 2–3 related interview questions for cross-linking

## File setup

- [ ] Copy `papers/p-template/` to `papers/pXX/` (two-digit id)
  - [ ] `overview.html`
  - [ ] `interactive.html`
  - [ ] `interactive.js` exporting `interactiveScript`
- [ ] Add/Update entry in `papers/manifest.json` with `title`, `authors`, `year`, `venue`, `tags`, `summary`, `dir`, `interactiveTitle`, and `relatedQuestions`
- [ ] Create or update `p/XX.html` share page (title, description, OG image, link to `index.html#paper-XX`)
- [ ] Confirm `relatedQuestions` ids exist in `questions/manifest.json` and `availableQuestions`

## Overview content

- [ ] Executive quick take summarises the practical ceiling and governance signal
- [ ] Business relevance block follows the quick take, includes 3–4 stakeholder bullets, and nests a white “Derivative example” card with a runnable workflow
- [ ] Include “How top-k maps to retrieval results” callout
- [ ] Include “What counts as a document” callout (and doc chunking guidance)
- [ ] Populate `Key insight`, `Method`, `Implication` cards with concise copy
- [ ] Evidence list cites at least two concrete results (theorem, metric, dataset)
- [ ] Roadmap bullets give actionable next steps for practitioners

## Interactive component

- [ ] Dimension / corpus / k sliders match paper defaults and include helper text
- [ ] Design tweaks: vectors-per-document slider, lexical reranker checkbox (with explanation), token retention slider
- [ ] Coverage outlook shows single-vector, multi-vector, and reranker metrics with colour-coded bar
- [ ] LIMIT-style simulator scenarios are realistic (≥8 queries) with names, expected docs, and optional hints
- [ ] Simulator summary explains observed vs expected recall and hints at mitigations
- [ ] All DOM lookups guarded; `interactiveScript` does not leak globals
- [ ] MathJax re-typeset if the interactive injects equations

## Integration tasks

- [ ] Hard refresh `index.html#paper-XX`; verify landing card, overview, interactive, and related-question buttons
- [ ] Run each simulator scenario; ensure coverage numbers, hints, and follow-up text make sense
- [ ] Confirm `all.html#papers` (and any curated lists) include the new paper title
- [ ] Open `p/XX.html` to verify metadata and CTA
- [ ] Update any documentation or release notes referencing the new paper
- [ ] Add a Latest Site Update entry in `updates.html` describing the new or revised paper

## Quality gates

- [ ] No console errors while interacting with the paper
- [ ] Layout holds on mobile widths (overview and interactive stack cleanly)
- [ ] Controls handle edge values (min/max sliders, toggling reranker, switching scenarios)
- [ ] Interactive remains responsive—no long-running loops or blocking recalculations
- [ ] Files saved as UTF-8 with `\n` line endings; emoji and punctuation render correctly

Tick every box before requesting review or publishing the paper explainer.
