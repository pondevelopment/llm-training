# Paper Checklist
## Before you start

- [ ] Read `PAPER_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md` for structure and interactive expectations
- [ ] Confirm the paper’s core claim, key evidence, and intended audience (architects/PMs vs researchers)
- [ ] Identify 2–3 related interview questions for cross-linking
- [ ] **Cross-check all statistics against the source paper:** Verify exact numbers from tables/figures (not abstract claims). Calculate percentage changes yourself. Use search/grep on extracted text to find exact values.
- [ ] **Verify model/system lists:** Cross-check which models/systems were actually tested vs. only mentioned elsewhere (e.g., graders, cited baselines). Don’t assume—confirm in methodology sections.

## File setup

- [ ] Copy `papers/p-template/` to `papers/pXX/` (two-digit id)
  - [ ] `overview.html`
  - [ ] `interactive.html`
  - [ ] `interactive.js` exporting `interactiveScript`
- [ ] Add/Update entry in `papers/manifest.json` with `title`, `authors`, `year`, `venue`, `tags`, `summary`, `dir`, `interactiveTitle`, and `relatedQuestions`
- [ ] Create or update `p/XX.html` share page with complete social media meta tags:
  - [ ] Meta description (2-3 sentences with key findings)
  - [ ] Open Graph tags: `og:type`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url`, `og:image`, `og:site_name`
  - [ ] Twitter Card tags: `twitter:card` (summary_large_image), `twitter:title`, `twitter:description`, `twitter:image`
  - [ ] Use full GitHub Pages URL: `https://pondevelopment.github.io/llm-training/`
  - [ ] Use `llm_training.png` for `og:image` and `twitter:image`
  - [ ] Page content highlights key statistics upfront with specific CTA
  - [ ] Link points to `../index.html#paper-XX`
- [ ] Confirm `relatedQuestions` ids exist in `questions/manifest.json` and `availableQuestions`

## Overview structure (HTML)

- [ ] **Paper header** (`panel panel-info`):
  - [ ] Container uses `flex items-center justify-between gap-4` (no flex-wrap)
  - [ ] Left wrapper: `flex-1 min-w-0` for title/authors
  - [ ] Button has `flex-shrink-0` to stay on same line as title
  - [ ] "View paper" button positioned **top-right** with `btn-soft`, `data-accent="foundations"`, and ↗ icon
  - [ ] Title (h2), authors • venue (year), 2–3 sentence summary
- [ ] **Plain-language explainer**: Nested card (`panel panel-neutral-soft`) with 1–2 sentence analogy making the core insight accessible
- [ ] **Executive quick take** (`panel panel-neutral`): 🧭 icon + uppercase header, 2–3 sentences, 3 bulleted key points
- [ ] **Business relevance** (`panel panel-success`): 💼 icon, 3–4 stakeholder bullets, nested "Derivative example" card (`panel-neutral-soft`)
- [ ] **Supporting callouts** (optional, `panel panel-info`): 2-column grid unpacking concepts (~80–120 words each)
- [ ] **Key insight / Method / Implication** (`panel panel-neutral`): 3-column grid with focused cards
- [ ] **Evidence** (`panel panel-neutral`): 🧪 icon, bulleted list citing ≥2 concrete results with precise metrics
- [ ] **Roadmap** (`panel panel-warning`): 🔭 icon, actionable next steps
  - [ ] Uses `panel panel-warning` with theme classes only (never hardcoded colors)
  - [ ] Includes a short context paragraph introducing the roadmap items
  - [ ] Optional: Nested subsections use `panel panel-info` with `<h4>` headings
  - [ ] Closes with actionable bulleted list (3–5 items)
  - [ ] Never uses inline styles
- [ ] All sections use theme classes: `panel panel-[type]`, `text-heading`, `panel-muted`, `text-body`
- [ ] Icon consistency: 🧭 Executive quick take, 💼 Business relevance, 🧪 Evidence, 🔭 Roadmap

## Overview content

- [ ] Executive quick take summarises the practical ceiling and governance signal
- [ ] Business relevance block follows the quick take, includes 3–4 stakeholder bullets, and nests a white “Derivative example” card with a runnable workflow
- [ ] Include “How top-k maps to retrieval results” callout
- [ ] Include “What counts as a document” callout (and doc chunking guidance)
- [ ] Populate `Key insight`, `Method`, `Implication` cards with concise copy
- [ ] Evidence list cites at least two concrete results (theorem, metric, dataset)
- [ ] Roadmap bullets give actionable next steps for practitioners

## Interactive component

- [ ] **Add concrete examples for technical concepts:** Use highlighted panels (`panel panel-neutral-soft`) with real-world analogies before introducing complex controls (e.g., "Think of parallel scaling like trying multiple approaches" or "Flight booking: successes teach steps, failures teach guardrails")
- [ ] **Explain metric relationships:** If showing multiple metrics that could be misunderstood (e.g., "compliance with invalid requests" + "compliance with valid requests"), add text clarifying what success looks like: "Low invalid + high valid = selective behavior"
- [ ] **Distinguish baseline from mitigation:** Use color coding (amber for problematic baseline, green for successful mitigation) and clear messaging ("Complies with ALL requests indiscriminately" vs "Maintains helpfulness while rejecting dangerous requests")
- [ ] **Model OOD behavior if applicable:** If paper tests generalization, add domain selector with appropriate effectiveness penalties for different strategies (document assumptions in code comments)
- [ ] **Root wrapper:** `<section class="space-y-6" id="pXX-explorer">` (semantic HTML, not div)
- [ ] **NO inline styles:** No `<style>` blocks - use Tailwind utility classes only
- [ ] **Panel structure:**
  - [ ] Controls/inputs: `panel panel-info` or `panel panel-neutral`
  - [ ] Results/output: `panel panel-neutral` with nested `panel-neutral-soft` for metrics
  - [ ] Insights/warnings: `panel panel-warning` or `panel panel-success`
  - [ ] Use single panel classes only (e.g., `panel panel-info` ✅)
- [ ] **Min-height for dynamic content:** Use inline Tailwind classes like `min-h-[2.75rem]` instead of custom CSS
- [ ] Dimension / corpus / k sliders match paper defaults and include helper text
- [ ] Design tweaks: vectors-per-document slider, lexical reranker checkbox (with explanation), token retention slider
- [ ] Coverage outlook shows single-vector, multi-vector, and reranker metrics with colour-coded bar
- [ ] LIMIT-style simulator scenarios are realistic (≥8 queries) with names, expected docs, and optional hints
- [ ] Simulator summary explains observed vs expected recall and hints at mitigations
- [ ] All DOM lookups guarded; `interactiveScript` does not leak globals
- [ ] MathJax re-typeset if the interactive injects equations

## Integration tasks

- [ ] Hard refresh `index.html#paper-XX`; verify landing card, overview, interactive, and related-question buttons
- [ ] Run each simulator scenario; ensure coverage numbers, hints, and follow-up text make sense
- [ ] Confirm `all.html#papers` (and any curated lists) include the new paper title
- [ ] Open `p/XX.html` to verify metadata and CTA
- [ ] Update any documentation or release notes referencing the new paper
- [ ] Add a Latest Site Update entry in `updates.html` describing the new or revised paper

## Quality gates

- [ ] No console errors while interacting with the paper
- [ ] Layout holds on mobile widths (overview and interactive stack cleanly)
- [ ] Controls handle edge values (min/max sliders, toggling reranker, switching scenarios)
- [ ] Interactive remains responsive—no long-running loops or blocking recalculations
- [ ] Files saved as UTF-8 with `\n` line endings; emoji and punctuation render correctly
- [ ] **Visual consistency check:** Use browser to compare side-by-side with reference papers (Paper 7 is current standard) - verify header structure, spacing (`space-y-5`), padding (`p-4`), plain-language explainer format, and panel layouts match exactly
