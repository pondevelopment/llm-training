## Quick Reference: Element IDs Pattern

Replace `X` with your question number:
- `qX-text-input` - Main input field
- `qX-strategy` - Radio button group name
- `qX-output` - Results display area
- `qX-legend` - Legend/key display
- `qX-explanation` - Educational explanation
- `qX-strategy-indicator` - Current strategy display
- `qX-example-btn` - Example cycling button

## Quick Reference: CSS Classes

**Containers:** `space-y-4`, `space-y-6`, `grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-4`
**Backgrounds:** `bg-blue-50`, `bg-white`, `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-indigo-50`
**Borders:** `border border-gray-200 rounded-lg`, `border-l-4 border-blue-400`
**Text:** `text-sm font-medium text-gray-700`, `font-semibold text-blue-900`
**Interactive:** `hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors cursor-pointer`

## MathJax Integration Requirements

### LaTeX Syntax Standards
- [ ] Use `$$...$$` for display math (centered equations)
- [ ] Use `$...$` for inline math expressions
- [ ] Use `\mathbf{}` for bold vectors and matrices
- [ ] Use `\frac{}{}` for fractions instead of HTML
- [ ] Use `\text{}` for text within mathematical expressions
- [ ] Use standard LaTeX commands only (no custom macros)

### Mathematical Expression Testing
- [ ] All equations render without "Math input error" messages
- [ ] Mathematical expressions display with proper fonts and sizing
- [ ] Complex equations with matrices render correctly
- [ ] Inline math integrates well with surrounding text
- [ ] Display math is properly centered and formatted

### Common LaTeX Patterns to Use
- [ ] Partial derivatives: `\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}`
- [ ] Matrices: `\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}`
- [ ] Vectors: `\mathbf{x}`, `\mathbf{W}`
- [ ] Number sets: `\mathbb{R}`, `\mathbb{C}`
- [ ] Functions: `\text{softmax}`, `\text{ReLU}`
- [ ] Greek letters: `\alpha`, `\beta`, `\theta`

### Mathematical Content Structure
- [ ] Wrap display math in appropriate containers (`.math-equation`, etc.)
- [ ] Include explanatory text before and after complex equations
- [ ] Use consistent mathematical notation throughout the question
- [ ] Provide context for all mathematical symbols used
