# LLM Interview Questions

[➡️ Open the latest version (GitHub Pages)](https://pondevelopment.github.io/llm-training/#question-1)


An interactive learning experience with hands-on examples for the most important Large Language Model (LLM) interview questions.

## 🎯 Overview

This project is a single‑page, static web app covering an expanding set of essential LLM questions. Every question includes a clear explanation and most include interactive mini‑simulators. There’s also a searchable Glossary with deep links into the questions.

## � Features

- Curated questions with explanations and interactive widgets (continuously growing)
- Searchable in‑app Glossary with “Learn more: Question N →” cross‑links
- Shareable deep links per question (Share button or press “S”)
- Keyboard navigation (← / →), and a top dropdown to jump anywhere
- Math rendering via MathJax (inline and display equations)
- Lightweight: pure HTML/JS/CSS; no build step needed; mobile-friendly

## 📚 Topics covered (selection)

- Tokenization, embeddings, attention and multi‑head attention
- Context window, KV cache, decoding (greedy, beam, top‑k/top‑p, temperature)
- LoRA/QLoRA and PEFT, RLHF and alignment
- MoE, RAG, few/zero‑shot prompting, CoT
- Math foundations: softmax, cross‑entropy, gradients, Jacobians, eigenvalues
- Deployment trade‑offs: latency, cost, safety, privacy, quantization, distillation

## 🛠️ Technologies

- HTML + Tailwind CSS (CDN)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- MathJax v3 (tex-svg)

## 🎮 How to run

1) Download or clone the repo
2) Open `index.html` in a modern browser (no server needed)

Tips inside the app:

- Use the dropdown or ← / → to navigate
- Press “S” to copy a shareable deep link to the current question
- Click “Glossary” in the header to browse definitions and jump to questions


## 🔧 Development

### Adding a new question

1. Copy `questions/q-template/` to `questions/qXX/` (two-digit id).
2. Customize `answer.html`, `interactive.html`, and `interactive.js` (ensure it exports `interactiveScript`).
3. Add the id to `questions/manifest.json` with a `dir` entry and update `interactiveTitle`.
4. Verify `availableQuestions` (and learning paths) in `js/app.js`, update `/q/XX.html`, then follow `QUESTION_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md` and `QUESTION_CHECKLIST.md`.

Question assets:
- `answer.html`: HTML fragment rendered inside the viewer
- `interactive.html`: markup for controls/results
- `interactive.js`: exports `interactiveScript` (CommonJS + browser global)
- MathJax: call `window.MathJax?.typesetPromise` after injecting new math markup


### Notable implementation details

- Custom loader reads `questions/manifest.json` and fetches HTML/JS assets per question directory
- Adjacent questions are opportunistically preloaded to reduce perceived latency
- MathJax rendering is retried on transient errors; see `index.html` startup config

### AI-assisted coding prompt

See `COPILOT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` for repository-wide rules when using AI assistants.

- Commit/push only on explicit user request
- Assume a local test server at <http://127.0.0.1:5501> for smoke checks
