          This research agenda proposes a comprehensive framework organizing AI in organizations around <strong>four core capabilities</strong> (Automation, Engagement, Insight/Decisions, Innovation) and <strong>ten fundamental tensions</strong>—providing practitioners with a systematic approach to anticipate capability-specific challenges and adopt appropriate governance strategies.

        <h2>Framework Structure</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Automation capability:</strong> Physical robots, RPA, ML for structured tasks—navigating substitution (tasks vs jobs) and augmentation (automation vs human judgment) tensions</li>
          <li><strong>Engagement capability:</strong> Chatbots, conversational AI, emotion AI—balancing humanlike vs machinelike interaction and managing emotion AI privacy/ethics concerns</li>
          <li><strong>Insight/Decisions capability:</strong> ML algorithms, neural networks, predictive analytics—addressing accountability gaps, human vs machine bias, rationality vs judgment, and learning vs myopia</li>
          <li><strong>Innovation capability:</strong> Generative AI, deep learning for R&D—managing exploration vs exploitation trade-offs and credit allocation for AI-generated innovations</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="highlights">
        <h2>Key Tensions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Substitution of tasks not jobs:</strong> Robots rising from 10% to 25% by 2025 (Sirkin), but most occupations have replaceable tasks without full replaceability (Brynjolfsson)—manage power reconfigurations as some groups deskilled while others elevated</li>
          <li><strong>Automation vs augmentation:</strong> Binary choice between efficiency (automation) and judgment (augmentation)—overemphasis on either creates detrimental performance consequences; requires hybrid approaches</li>
          <li><strong>Humanlike vs machinelike:</strong> Anthropomorphism increases conversions but triggers oscillation effect where users alternate between treating bot as human and probing limits—context determines appropriate level</li>
          <li><strong>Emotion AI ethics:</strong> Sentiment/facial/voice monitoring enhances adaptation but raises privacy, nudging abuse, and cultural bias concerns—consent and boundaries required</li>
          <li><strong>Accountability gaps:</strong> Machines lack intentionality required for responsibility; humans can't take responsibility when algorithmic decisions made at superhuman speed/scale—explainability and protocols needed</li>
          <li><strong>Human vs machine bias:</strong> Automated decisions assumed bias-free, but training data creates systematic discrimination (racist recidivism predictions, gender-biased hiring)—requires audits and transparency</li>
          <li><strong>Rationality vs judgment:</strong> ML overcomes bounded rationality but overreliance erodes intuitive judgment, creates emotional detachment, and causes passive acceptance—maintain human involvement</li>
          <li><strong>Learning vs myopia:</strong> Path dependency and temporal myopia from training on historical data—unprecedented situations (COVID-19) require human oversight when historical patterns insufficient</li>
          <li><strong>Exploration vs exploitation:</strong> Large training data favors exploitation (existing knowledge) over exploration (novelty)—abundant data enables AI innovation, limited data requires human creativity</li>
          <li><strong>Credit allocation:</strong> Algorithms increasingly autonomous innovators, but authorship unclear—proposed solution grants credit to programmers/owners, raising incentive allocation questions</li>
        </ul>
