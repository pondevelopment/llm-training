          Field experiment with 776 Procter &amp; Gamble professionals reveals GenAI can act as a <strong>"cybernetic teammate"</strong> that replicates three pillars of human teamwork: <strong>performance gains, expertise sharing, and social engagement</strong>. Individuals with AI matched the quality of two-person cross-functional teams without AI, broke down functional silos between Commercial and R&amp;D roles, and reported emotional benefits matching human collaboration—fundamentally reshaping optimal team size and structure for knowledge work.

        <h2>Performance: AI Enables Individuals to Match Teams</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Quality improvements over solo baseline:</strong> Teams without AI +0.24 SD (p &lt; 0.05), individuals with AI +0.37 SD (p &lt; 0.01), teams with AI +0.39 SD (p &lt; 0.01)—AI-enabled individuals matched traditional team performance</li>
          <li><strong>Breakthrough outcomes:</strong> Teams with AI 3× more likely to produce top 10% solutions (9.2 percentage point increase from 5.8% baseline)—AI complements teamwork for exceptional results</li>
          <li><strong>Efficiency gains:</strong> Individuals with AI completed tasks 16.4% faster while producing significantly longer, more comprehensive solutions—double benefit of speed and thoroughness</li>
          <li><strong>Confidence gap:</strong> Despite higher objective quality, AI users were 9.2 percentage points less likely to expect top 10% placement—workers underestimate AI's contribution</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="highlights">
        <h2>Expertise: Breaking Down Functional Silos</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Boundary-spanning knowledge:</strong> Without AI, Commercial professionals proposed commercial solutions, R&amp;D proposed technical solutions. With AI, both produced similarly balanced technical-commercial solutions regardless of background—replicating team-level knowledge integration</li>
          <li><strong>Democratizing task expertise:</strong> Non-core-job employees with AI matched teams containing core-job experts—AI substituted for experience and guidance typically provided by veteran teammates</li>
          <li><strong>Reduced dominance effects:</strong> Teams without AI showed bimodal distributions (clustering around dominant member's perspective). Teams with AI produced uniform distributions—both perspectives contributed more equally</li>
          <li><strong>Quality independence:</strong> Solution quality didn't vary by technical orientation—AI-enabled boundary spanning maintained effectiveness across the technical-commercial spectrum</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="highlights">
        <h2>Sociality: Positive Emotional Responses</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Positive emotions:</strong> Individuals with AI +0.457 SD (p &lt; 0.01), teams with AI +0.635 SD (p &lt; 0.01)—significantly higher excitement, energy, and enthusiasm compared to baseline</li>
          <li><strong>Negative emotions:</strong> Both individuals and teams with AI showed -0.23 SD reduction (p &lt; 0.05) in anxiety, frustration, and distress</li>
          <li><strong>Matching human collaboration:</strong> Individuals with AI reported emotional responses matching or exceeding teams without AI—AI substitutes for some motivational benefits of human teamwork</li>
          <li><strong>Adoption correlation:</strong> Participants reporting larger increases in expected future AI use showed more positive emotions—positive experiences may drive adoption</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="highlights">
        <h2>Organizational Implications</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rethinking optimal team size:</strong> AI-enabled individuals can handle tasks that previously required cross-functional teams—opportunities for more flexible, efficient structures while reducing coordination costs</li>
          <li><strong>Efficiency vs. breakthrough trade-off:</strong> Use individual+AI for average quality with speed; use team+AI for top-tier outcomes. Different optimization strategies for different business needs</li>
          <li><strong>AI prompting as critical skill:</strong> Participants were relatively inexperienced, suggesting benefits may be lower bound. Training in boundary-spanning AI interaction (using AI to reason across functional domains) becomes strategic priority</li>
          <li><strong>Balancing learning objectives:</strong> While AI enables smaller teams and faster work, traditional teamwork serves mentorship and culture-building functions—explicit policies needed for when these secondary benefits justify maintaining larger structures</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>
        <strong>Experimental design:</strong> 776 P&amp;G professionals (Commercial and R&amp;D functions) randomized to 2×2 conditions (individual/team × with/without GPT-4) in one-day virtual product innovation workshop. Teams comprised 1 Commercial + 1 R&amp;D professional. Solutions evaluated by blind human experts on quality (1–10 scale). Participants reported emotions before and after task.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Note:</strong> "Cybernetic" references Norbert Wiener's concept of feedback-regulated systems that interact dynamically with their environment—here, AI functioning as an active collaborator providing real-time responses, bridging expertise gaps, and influencing emotional states, rather than a passive tool.
