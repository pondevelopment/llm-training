          Study of 85 professionals in accounting and law firms (2018–2020) responding to AI adoption reveals that rather than AI ending the professions, professionals engaged in <strong>intertwined boundary work</strong>—four interdependent modes (defending, creating, negotiating, coalescing) linked by opportunity and necessity ties—reconfiguring their work, expanding into advisory services, collaborating with technologists, and reshaping partnerships to maintain professional status while exploiting AI's capabilities.

      <section class="highlights">
        <h2>Four Modes of Boundary Work</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Defending (competitive):</strong> Professionals relinquished routine data work to AI (adjusted claims) while restating that judgment, ambiguity tolerance, and client relationship skills remain uniquely human—maintaining boundaries around high-value work</li>
          <li><strong>Creating (competitive):</strong> AI insights enabled new advisory domains—100% audit coverage, proactive contract risk analysis, dispute pattern training—expanding jurisdiction beyond traditional compliance services</li>
          <li><strong>Negotiating (collaborative):</strong> Boundary bridging to technologists—data scientists, AI specialists, project managers—gained access to traditionally sacrosanct professional spaces (client meetings, partnerships)</li>
          <li><strong>Coalescing (configurational):</strong> Partnership boundaries redefined—technologists gained partner status, authority to manage professional workflows, challenging traditional autonomy and credential-based hierarchies</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="highlights">
        <h2>Interdependencies: Opportunity and Necessity Ties</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Opportunity tie (defending → creating):</strong> Adjusted claims legitimating AI for data tasks created openings to define new advisory domains by positioning AI as augmentation tool combining insights with professional judgment</li>
          <li><strong>Necessity tie (creating → negotiating):</strong> New advisory services required technologists to configure AI systems and interpret outputs—boundary bridging became necessary, not optional, for advisory work to succeed</li>
          <li><strong>Necessity tie (negotiating → coalescing):</strong> Technologists' central role in service delivery required partnership reform—couldn't sustain collaboration if they lacked authority or remained "non-professionals"</li>
          <li><strong>Recursive reinforcement:</strong> Technologist partners gained legitimacy to manage processes, consolidating boundary bridging; new advisory domains further justified adjusted claims about AI's role</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="highlights">
        <h2>Research Method</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Interviews:</strong> 85 total (51 in-depth + 34 scoping) with accounting (25 in-depth, 15 scoping) and law (26 in-depth, 19 scoping) professionals in England, 2018–2020</li>
          <li><strong>Documents:</strong> 876 industry articles and reports (587 Accounting Today, 271 Legal Week, 18 professional body/consultant reports)</li>
          <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Inductive theory elaboration comparing AI responses to documented boundary work modes, identifying mechanisms (adjusting/restating claims, defining domains, boundary bridging, redefining exclusions) and ties (opportunity, necessity)</li>
          <li><strong>Context:</strong> AI tools (Kira, InFlo, Mindbridge, LawGeex, Luminance) automated document review, audit sampling, contract analysis—tasks previously done by junior professionals</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="highlights">
        <h2>Organizational Impacts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Partnership evolution:</strong> Firms now include data scientists, project managers, innovation officers without professional qualifications as partners or "Principals" with partnership-level authority</li>
          <li><strong>Career path changes:</strong> 20% of new hires in some firms are data scientists; technologists on partnership track based on advisory revenue generation, not traditional credentials</li>
          <li><strong>Service model pivot:</strong> Compliance → advisory transformation; revenue models shift from hourly billing to value-based consulting; advisory services now revenue majority in some firms</li>
          <li><strong>Management structures:</strong> Flatter hierarchies; technologists authorize process changes; standardized practices replace individual professional autonomy; cross-functional collaboration mandatory</li>
          <li><strong>Professional jurisdiction:</strong> Expanded domains (proactive risk management, business consulting, training services) while relinquishing routine data work to AI/technologists</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="highlights">
        <h2>Theoretical Contributions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intertwined boundary work concept:</strong> Process through which professionals respond to disruptions by engaging in multiple interdependent modes—not isolated tactics but synergistic system of changes</li>
          <li><strong>Trigger mechanisms:</strong> One mode can trigger another (creating triggered by defending, not just by new groups seeking domains); interdependencies shape what's possible</li>
          <li><strong>Complementary not conflicting:</strong> Simultaneous strengthening and weakening of boundaries can be complementary (not just conflicting) when linked by opportunity/necessity ties</li>
          <li><strong>Beyond defense:</strong> Severe disruptions require creative responses combining competitive, collaborative, and configurational boundary work—isolated defensive moves fail</li>
          <li><strong>Inter-professional collaboration:</strong> New profession (technologists) takes strategic not subordinate role, driving boundary work by incumbent professionals (accountants/lawyers)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="highlights">
        <h2>Practical Implications</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Holistic change strategies:</strong> Organizations adopting AI need comprehensive planning that anticipates cascading boundary shifts—isolated interventions (just training, just hiring) fail</li>
          <li><strong>Pre-deployment planning:</strong> Map boundary work interdependencies before AI rollout; identify which defensive claims enable expansion opportunities and which collaborations become necessary</li>
          <li><strong>Career architecture:</strong> Design parallel paths for AI specialists and domain experts; plan partnership/authority models giving technologists real influence, not just support roles</li>
          <li><strong>Sequential dependencies:</strong> Early moves (relinquishing routine work) shape later possibilities (advisory pivots); sequence changes strategically to exploit opportunity ties</li>
          <li><strong>Mandatory redesign:</strong> When new services require cross-functional collaboration, organizational redesign (flatter structures, shared authority) becomes necessary for success</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="takeaway">
        <h2>Bottom line</h2>
        <p>
          AI doesn't end professions—it reconfigures them through intertwined boundary work. Professionals who link defending moves to expansion opportunities (via adjusted claims enabling new domains), enable necessary collaborations (boundary bridging to technologists), and reshape governance structures (partnership reform) transform AI disruption from existential threat into strategic advantage. The interdependencies—not individual tactics—sustain professional status. Organizations attempting isolated changes (training without collaboration planning, hiring without partnership models, pilots without holistic strategy) miss the cascading boundary shifts that make AI adoption succeed.
