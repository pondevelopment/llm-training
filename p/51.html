        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          A three-wave longitudinal study of 381 South Korean employees measured organizational AI adoption, psychological safety, ethical leadership, and depression symptoms at separate time intervals. The research reveals that AI adoption significantly reduces psychological safety—the belief that it is safe to take interpersonal risks, voice concerns, and ask for help—which in turn increases depression risk. However, ethical leadership (characterized by transparency, fairness, and inclusive decision-making about AI-driven role changes) substantially moderates this effect, buffering employees against psychological harm.

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mediation pathway:</strong> AI adoption significantly reduces psychological safety (β = −0.324, p &lt; 0.001), which significantly increases depression (β = −0.211, p &lt; 0.001). Psychological safety fully mediates the AI-to-depression relationship.</li>
          <li><strong>Moderation effect:</strong> Ethical leadership significantly moderates the AI adoption→psychological safety link (β = 0.211, p &lt; 0.001), reducing the psychological harm of AI deployment.</li>
          <li><strong>Measurement quality:</strong> High reliability (Cronbach's α: AI adoption 0.943, ethical leadership 0.867, psychological safety 0.783, depression 0.948). Temporal separation of variables across three time points reduces common method bias.</li>
          <li><strong>Theoretical contributions:</strong> Integrates Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, and Uncertainty Reduction theory to explain how AI adoption creates psychological costs and how ethical leadership buffers these costs.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="paper-section">
        <h2>Business Relevance</h2>
        <p><strong>Employee well-being ROI:</strong> Depression increases absenteeism, healthcare costs, and turnover. Organizations that pair AI deployment with ethical leadership practices preserve psychological safety and reduce mental health risks.</p>
        <p><strong>Change management innovation:</strong> Don't treat leadership as an afterthought in AI implementation. Make psychological safety a KPI; measure well-being before, during, and after AI rollouts. Train managers in transparent communication about AI capabilities/limitations, inclusive decision-making, and fair performance evaluation.</p>
        <p><strong>Organizational culture:</strong> High ethical leadership during AI transitions sustains engagement, reduces burnout, and maintains talent. Organizations that fail to build psychological safety face retention crises and culture erosion.</p>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Design:</strong> Three-wave longitudinal survey with 5–6 week intervals between measurement periods.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Sample:</strong> 381 employees from South Korean organizations (manufacturing, services, finance, IT, healthcare, education sectors). Participants recruited through Macromil Embrain, a research panel with 5.84 million potential participants. Participants aged 20+, currently employed in domestic companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Measures:</strong> All constructs measured on 5-point Likert scales. AI adoption (5 items: HR, operations, marketing, strategy, finance systems). Ethical leadership (10 items: disciplining violations, discussing ethics, setting example, asking what's right, listening, trustworthiness). Psychological safety (7 items: safe to take risks, voice problems, ask for help, no deliberate undermining). Depression (CES-D-10: 10 items covering hopelessness, loneliness, depressed mood, focus/sleep difficulties).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Analysis:</strong> SPSS 28 for preliminary correlations. AMOS 28 for Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Bootstrapping (10,000 samples) with 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals to test mediation. Harman's one-factor test confirmed common method bias unlikely (first factor = 26% variance, well below 50% threshold).

        <h2>Implications</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>For practitioners:</strong> AI adoption is a leadership challenge, not just a technical one. Organizations need to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Audit psychological safety before and during AI pilots. Use standardized measures (e.g., Edmondson's 7-item scale) to track changes in employee sense of safety.</li>
          <li>Train managers in ethical AI leadership: transparent communication about AI's role and limitations, involvement of employees in adoption decisions, and fair evaluation criteria that account for transition periods.</li>
          <li>Create ethical AI governance boards with authority to slow rollouts if psychological safety indicators deteriorate or fairness concerns emerge.</li>
          <li>Monitor well-being signals (depression screening, engagement surveys, turnover rates) monthly for 6–12 months post-deployment. Flag teams with declining safety or rising mental health risks and intensify leadership interventions.</li>
        </ul>
