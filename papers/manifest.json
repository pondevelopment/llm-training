Prompt engineering (rejection hints + factual recall cues) reduces compliance from 100% to 38%, while fine-tuning on just 300 illogical examples achieves 100% rejection with 79% correct reasoning, generalizing across medical specialties without over-rejecting valid requests (98% accuracy maintained).",
