      The authors combine a nationally representative UK survey with randomized trials that pit GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Mistral chatbots against traditional search. They find that voters already lean on AI for election research, that guardrailed models lift belief in true facts and suppress misinformation as effectively as search, and that even persuasive or sycophantic prompts fail to shift attitudes. GPT-4o delivered the quickest task completions, Claude 3.5 matched its epistemic gains, and Mistral trailed slightly while staying within overlapping confidence intervals.

      Chatbots are already a mainstream election research tool: roughly one in eight UK voters turned to them in 2024. In controlled trials they matched web search at boosting true beliefs, did not amplify misinformation, and stayed neutral even when pushed toward persuasion, suggesting that current guardrails hold up under everyday stress.

      <li><strong class="text-heading">Adoption reality:</strong> 32% of chatbot users applied them to political decisions during the UK general election campaign.</li>

        Treat guardrailed chatbots as a first-class electoral research channel. These results show they already serve mainstream voters without the misinformation spike many risk teams fear.
