      Picture a service firm with two kinds of problem solvers: most people follow established playbooks, and a tiny "genius" crew invents fresh answers when the work does not fit any template. The paper explores what happens when AI tools can act like extra geniuses on call. In this setup, a human genius can always improvise a solution but spends more effort the stranger the request. Routine teammates stick to the scripts they already know, so their answers get shaky once an issue drifts too far from familiar ground.

      <p class="panel-muted">Imagine a pizza shop where most staff follow the menu, but you have one chef who can improvise custom orders. The paper asks: what if you could hire AI "chefs" who handle the weird requests, freeing your human expert for only the truly impossible orders?</p>

    <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-body">
      Treat transformative AI as a surge of extra experts. Use it to cover the repetitive middle while your scarce humans double down on frontier questions. Optimal routing keeps human geniuses anchored at the boundary where they deliver the highest marginal lift. If AI keeps improving, routine roles will shrink unless you slow deployment or find new tasks for those teams.

    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm panel-muted">
      <li><strong>Smart routing beats raw brainpower:</strong> The win comes from steering each request to the right helper, not from hiring the "smartest" person overall.</li>
      <li><strong>Humans keep the weird stuff:</strong> They shine on messy, one-off situations where context and judgement matter.</li>
      <li><strong>AI eats the middle tier:</strong> Once AI handles mid-scope questions with similar cost and accuracy, routine teams have little left to do.</li>
