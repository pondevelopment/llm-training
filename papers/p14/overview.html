      Manning and Aguirre pair AI exposure data with an adaptive capacity index that measures how well workers can navigate job transitions. Instead of viewing exposure as inevitable displacement, they show where the workforce is resilient and where pockets of vulnerability cluster.

      <p class="font-semibold text-heading">Plain-language explainer</p>
      <p class="text-body">Picture a U.S. jobs heatmap. Bright areas mark roles where AI can already replicate everyday tasks; cooler areas show how much savings, portable skills, and local job options workers have to bounce into something new.</p>
      <p class="text-body">Professional roles usually glow bright but also carry strong safety nets&mdash;they can pivot. Office administrators and clerical staff light up as high exposure with thin buffers. Those are the workers this paper says to prioritise with retraining budgets, wage insurance, and mobility support.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="text-xs leading-relaxed text-muted">
      Their index blends four ingredients&mdash;liquid savings, transferable skills, local job density, and age&mdash;for 300 occupations covering 91.9% of U.S. employment. The result helps policymakers triage support, distinguishing exposed workers likely to bounce back from those who may need targeted interventions.

      AI exposure alone is a blunt instrument. Cross it with adaptive capacity to spot both resilience and risk. Administrative and clerical workers surface as the most exposed with the fewest cushions, while many professional jobs combine high exposure with strong fallback options.
