      Jones builds a flexible model of the "ideas production function," placing both people and AI-powered machines inside R&amp;D. The payoff from smarter machines depends on three levers: how many research tasks AI can take on, how well it performs each task, and which complementary bottlenecks (labs, data, regulation) still bind when machine intelligence soars.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xs panel-muted leading-relaxed">
      The framework spans everything from modest copilots to superintelligent lab partners and covers R&amp;D goals ranging from drug discovery to national security. It clarifies what to measure today‚Äîtask coverage, relative productivity, and bottlenecks‚Äîto forecast whether AI actually speeds up progress.

      <p class="font-semibold">Plain-language explainer</p>
      <p class="panel-muted">Imagine a research shop that relies on both scientists and lab machines. Smarter AI is like upgrading the machines so they can run more experiments, interpret data faster, or even write code. The gains only stick if other ingredients‚Äîphysical labs, datasets, approvals‚Äîkeep pace. Jones' model shows how to spot the new bottleneck when "intelligence" is no longer scarce.</p>
