(AGI)foreconomicgrowthandlabormarkets. AGImakesitfeasibletoperformalleconomically
valuable work using compute. I distinguish between bottleneck and accessory work—tasks
essential vs. non-essential for unhindered growth. As computational resources expand: (i) the
economy automates all bottleneck work, (ii) some accessory work may be left untouched by AI
and assigned exclusively to humans, (iii) output becomes linear in compute and labor and its
growth is driven by the expansion of compute, (iv) wages converge to the opportunity cost of
computational resources required to reproduce human work, and (v) the share of labor income
in GDP converges to zero.
This chapter studies the long-run behavior of wages and growth in an economy whereArtificial
General Intelligence(AGI) is developed and computational resources increase over time. AGI allows
the economy to complete all relevant work using computing systems. These systems consume
computational resources but do not require human input, guidance, or effort to accomplish work.
The key economic problem is how to allocate finite (but growing) computational resources and
human labor to accomplishing the work needed to produce output. The chapter introduces a key
distinction between bottleneck and accessory work.
• Bottleneck workcomprises tasks essential for economic growth. Output cannot expand indefi-
nitely unless inputs in bottleneck tasks also expand or become infinitely valuable.
• Accessory workis non-essential to growth. Output can expand indefinitely even if these tasks
are discarded or limited in input.
My main theoretical result shows thatall bottleneck work is eventually automated while some
accessoryworkmaybeleftuntouchedbyAI.Oncethisoccurs,outputshiftsfrombeingmultiplica-
tive in compute and human effort to being additive, and the long-run growth rate of the economy
is pinned by the growth rate of compute.
Despite AI completing all bottleneck tasks without human input, people still hold jobs. They
can contribute by fulfilling bottleneck work. Human labor remains valuable because it saves
scarce computational resources. Alternatively, workers may perform accessory work, where it is
impractical to use compute since we already have too many workers. In the first case, wages are
pinned by the value of computational resources saved. In the later, wages are bounded above by
the value of computational resources it would cost to automate accessory work.
In sum, the advent of AGI changes the way labor is valued. Before AGI, wages reflected the
importance of bottleneck work and the scarcity of labor with the requisite skill for this work.
With AGI, wages reflect the computational cost of replicating the work produced by all human
labor. Despite the fact that human labor retains some value, its contribution to GDP and growth
becomesvanishinglysmall,withtheshareoflaborinGDPconvergingtozero,andallincomebeing
eventually accruing to compute.
I then expand the analysis to an economy where AGI can be used to complete scientific work,
accelerating the pace of technological progress. Without AGI for science, technological progress
is constrained by population growth (as in the semi-endogenous growth models of Jones, 1995;
1
Kortum, 1997; Segerstrom, 1998). With AGI, all scientific bottleneck work is automated and the
rate of technological progress is determined by the growth rate of compute. This may generate
sustained exponential growth despite shrinking population, but does not create a singularity or
infinite growth explosion.
The analysis here complements existing work on the economics of AI, including several contri-
butions in a previous NBER volume (see Aghion, Jones and Jones, 2019; Acemoglu and Restrepo,
2019). Methodologically, Ibuildonideasfromtaskmodels,whichcenterontheproblemofhowto
accomplish multiple work tasks using different production techniques (Autor, Levy and Murnane,
2003; Acemoglu and Autor, 2011; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018, see). As in these models, the core
economic problem I study is that of allocating work to human labor or AGI systems, and deriving
the implications of this process for wages and output. The focus on the transition to AGI is shared
withcomplementaryworkbyAntonKorinekandcollaboratorsthatinfluencedsomeofmythinking
(see Trammell and Korinek, 2023; Korinek and Suh, 2024). Outside of traditional economics, there
is a large and interesting literature on world building exercises imagining how the economy and
world are transformed by AGI (see Kokotajlo et al., 2025; Drago and Laine, 2025).
The chapter is organized as follows. Section 1 presents the analysis in a production economy
where AGI can be used to produce all production work with compute. Section 2 then extends
the analysis to a semi-endogenous growth economy where AGI can be used for scientific work.
Section3concludeswithadiscussionofpolicyandissuesrelatedtothedistributionofincomeand

specific type of work indexed by𝜔. I assumeΩis a finite (but large set).1
The quantity of work𝜔 completed at time𝑡is given by
𝑋𝑡(𝜔) = 𝐿𝑡(𝜔)+ 1
𝛼𝑡(𝜔)𝑄𝑡(𝜔). (1)

Work𝜔 can be accomplished by human labor𝐿𝑡(𝜔)or using computational resources𝑄𝑡(𝜔). The
quantityofworkproducedbyahumanperunitoftimeisnormalizedto1. Emulatingorreplicating
this work using computers costs𝛼𝑡(𝜔)units of compute. We could have𝛼𝑡(𝜔)= ∞so that it is
impossible to replicate human effort in𝜔 with computers.
The quantity of output produced is then
𝑌𝑡 = 𝐹({𝑋𝑡(𝜔)}𝜔∈Ω),
where 𝐹is increasing in all entries, differentiable, concave, and exhibits constant returns to scale. I
also assume marginal products converge in[0,∞]for any converging sequence of inputs in[0,∞].
There are different human skills, indexed by𝑠 ∈𝒮, and in quantity𝐻(𝑠). People of skill𝑠 can
accomplish work inΩ(𝑠)⊆ Ω, where theΩ(𝑠)partition Ω. This implies
Õ
𝜔∈Ω(𝑠)
𝐿𝑡(𝜔) ≤𝐻(𝑠).
The partitionΩ(𝑠)captures the degree to which skills can only be used for a given type of work
(Ω(𝑠)is a one-to-one mapping from𝒮to Ω) or they are general (Ω(𝑠)= Ωand there is a single
universal skill). The assumption that there is no overlap betweenΩ(𝑠)’s simplifies exposition.
The total quantity of computational resources at our disposal is𝑄𝑡. Think of this as the total
numberofcomputationstheeconomycanperformperunitoftime,givenitsdatacentersandchips.
The computational resource constraintof the economy is then

ThePremise: Theobjectivehereistocharacterizethebehaviorofaneconomyfacingtwoformsof

compute to run it?
ThefirstformoftechnologicalprogressconsideredisthedevelopmentofAGI.Thispremisecan
be expressed in terms of the work equation (1) as:
Premise 1(The economy develops AGI.). For all work𝜔 ∈Ω, 𝛼𝑡(𝜔)reaches a finite value by date𝑇(𝜔)

and converges to a terminal value𝛼(𝜔)∈( 0,∞)from there on.
AGI is the knowledge or technology for transforming raw compute into all types of useful
work. Acquiring AGI means we figured out how to train or create computer systems capable of
performingallworkcurrentlyaccomplishedbyhumans. ThisdefinitiondistinguishesbetweenAGI
and computational resources. AGI is the recipe of how to use compute—the input—to accomplish
anytypeofwork—theoutput. Doingsoconsumessomeofourfinitecomputationalresources, 𝑄𝑡.2
While I take this premise as a point of departure in my analysis, it is helpful to clarify three
points about what is being assumed here.
• Feasible vs Realized:The definition of AGI states that, in principle, we can replicate what
peopledowithenoughcompute. Dependingonthecomputingcosts 𝛼(𝜔)ofreplicatingwhat

finite and can be applied to more profitable uses.
• Physical work:Some work requires interacting physically with the world. The premise here
isthat,whenneeded,computersystemscancontrolmachineandhardwaretoaccomplishthis
work. Whenappropriate,Ire-interpret 𝑄𝑡 asabundleofenergyandcomputationalresources
that computers use to carry out both cognitive and physical work.
• Social work: one may argue some work requires social interaction and must be carried out
by humans. The “human touch” and “empathy” of a therapist or healthcare provider may be
impossible to replicate, creating a premium for work completed by people. The assumption
behindPremise1isthat quantityhasaqualityallitsown : anydeficitofcomputervshumansmay
be overcome by the sheer application of compute to the task at hand. Imagine, for example,
an AI system that perfectly emulates the best therapists in the world, is at your disposal at
any time, knows you perfectly, never gets tired, and is open to use 100% of its intellect and
capabilitiestohelpyouovercomeyouranxieties. Thesystemmaybetoocostlytobepractical,
2The definition used here differs from other concepts, such asTransformative AI(defined as “AI developments that
significantly transform the economy”) orSuper-intelligence (AGI that keeps recursively self-improves itself, reaching
levels of intelligence that far exceed human ones). The definition of AGI used here does not need AI to be super-
intelligent.

but would you insist on visiting a human therapist when you could instead be treated by this
superhumanteamofworldexperts? ImagineanAIsystemthatusesvastamountsofcompute
to diagnose and treat medical conditions. Would you keep a sick children from accessing
this medical attention because youinsist AI lacks “the human touch”? If valid, this argument
implies that we can still represent such situations by high values of𝛼(𝜔), which capture
the extra computing resources needed to compensate for the “human touch”. Whether it is
practical or not to perform such work with compute is a different question addressed below.

is that we will continue to expand computational resources in the future, in the same way we have
expanded them historically, with no obvious ceiling in the near or mid term and a limit that far
exceeds current computational resources.
Historically, we have greatly expanded computing capabilities since the creation of modern
computers and transistors in 1970. Computational resources can be measured inflops—the total
numberoffloating-pointoperationspersecondthatallcomputersintheeconomycouldcollectively
perform. From 1980 to 2007, we increased compute by three orders of magnitude, from1015 to1018
flops. Currently, our economy has a peak capacity of1021 flops. It is estimated that this could
increase to1054 flops in the long run, suggesting that there is plenty of room for compute to grow.
Forreference,ahumanbrainisestimatedtoperform 1016–1018 flops,socomputationalresourcesare
already en route to exceed human brainpower by orders of magnitude.3
Progress in computing capabilities is assumed exogenous and is subsumed in the path for𝑄𝑡.

Bottlenecks: In what follows, I let𝐹({𝑋(𝜔)})denote the output obtained when the quantity of
work is𝑋(𝜔)and 𝐹𝜔({𝑋(𝜔)})> 0 denote the marginal gain of work𝜔.
A core component of the analysis is defining bottleneck and accessory work.
Definition 1.Work𝜔is bottleneck if, for any{𝑋𝑡(𝜔)}such that𝐹({𝑋𝑡(𝜔)})is unbounded, either i.𝑋𝑡(𝜔)
is unbounded or ii.𝐹𝜔({𝑋𝑡(𝜔)})is unbounded.
The definition captures an intuitive notion of a bottleneck: a type of work that is necessary for
sustained growth, in the sense that it must expand or its price would inflate to exorbitant levels,
capturing an expanding share of output. Potential examples of bottleneck work includes feeding
andshelteringpeople,producingenergy,maintainingtheproductiveinfrastructureoftheeconomy,
advancing science, decision making, logistics and delivery, and maintaining national security as
well as policing nations to preserve order and stability. These types of work are mission critical in
the sense that is hard to imagine an economy that keeps growing in a sustained way but lacks any
of these components.
Definition 2.Work𝜔 is accessory if, there is𝑋𝑡(𝜔)such that𝐹({𝑋𝑡(𝜔)})is unbounded while both𝑋𝑡(𝜔)
and 𝐹𝜔({𝑋𝑡(𝜔)})are bounded.
The definition shows that accessory work is the opposite of a bottleneck: we can grow the
economy while keeping this type of work fixed and without commanding too high of a price.
Potential examples include work associated with arts and crafts, performing for others, literature,
and hospitality and fine dining. We may also have design and customer support work, which may
not scale with the economy either. Finally, we may have judicial work, as well as work associated
with religious and civic organizations, as well as nature preservation groups. Even the work
performedbyacademiceconomistsmayprovetobeaccessory,asitisunlikelytobecomeevermore
valuable in the future. These are just possible examples, as the exact partition of what turns out to
be a bottleneck or accessory work depends on future preferences, the structure of production, and
the key existential problems and challenges faced by future people.
1.1 Limit Behavior
This subsection characterizes the limit behavior of the economy as𝑡 →∞ under Premises 1 and
2. I characterize the properties of a competitive equilibrium: an allocation of compute and human
6
labor that maximizes output and where factors of production are paid their marginal products.
This choice highlights the key economic forces at play.
Proposition 1.All bottlenecks are eventually automated while some accessory work may be left to labor.
The proposition clarifies how work is carried out in the AGI economy. All bottleneck work is
eventuallyautomatedandproducedwithcompute,whilesomeaccessoryworkisleftexclusivelyto
humans. Human labor may still produce some bottleneck jointly with AGI, adding to the quantity
of work obtained, or may specialize fully in accessory work. In the special case where all work
is a bottleneck, the proposition implies thatall work is eventually automated and produced with
compute.
This last result seems to counter Ricardo’s principle ofComparative Advantage. We can think of
theAGIeconomyasaworldwhereweengageintradewith“acountryofgeniusesinadatacenter,”
exchanging compute for productive work.4 Wouldn’t Ricardo’s principle imply that the AGI and
human countries should fully specialize to maximize the gains from trade? Why is it optimal for
AGI to produce all bottleneck work?
The reason why this logic breaks is instructive and provides an heuristic proof of the proposi-
tion. Suppose AGI specializes in the production of a subset of work with compute while human
labor specializes in the remaining components. Over time, the economy will become unbalanced,
producing an expanding quantity of the first type of work and a fixed quantity of the later. This
imbalancecannotbeoptimal: tokeeptheeconomygrowingonemustexpand allbottleneckworkat
the same rate. The only circumstance in which such unbalanced path can be optimal is one where
the non-automated work is accessory, as claimed in the proposition.5
Let’s now characterize the behavior of output and wages once we reach the point when all
bottleneck work is automated. Define the compute-equivalent units (CEU) of skill𝑠as
CEU(𝑠) = max
𝜔∈Ω(𝑠)
𝛼(𝜔).
This gives the computational resources needed to replicate work carried by people of skill𝑠in the
4This apt metaphore is from Anthropic’s Amodei (2024).
5The idea that Ricardo’s principle of Comparative Advantage calls forfull specialization is a common misunder-
standing. Ricardo’s original2 ×2 example predicts thatat least oneof the two countries specializes (see chapter 2 in
Feenstra and Taylor, 2017, for a textbook treatment). When one country is large and endowed with enough resources
(the AGI country in our economy), the equilibrium involves the large country producing both goods and determining
their relative prices. The small country (humans), on the other hand, specializes in a single good, as in Proposition 1.

for someCEU(𝑠)< CEU(𝑠), where𝒜is the set of skills performing only automated work and𝒩the set of
skills that perform accessory work not automated.
Aggregate production possibilities in the economy become additive in compute and labor, with
labor expressed in units of compute. This holds foranyinitial production function𝐹. For example,
if the different forms of work are combined a-la Cobb-Douglas, we would go from an economy
where compute and human labor are combined in a multiplicative way (before AGI is developed)
toonewheretheyarecombinedinanadditiveway(onceAGIisdevelopedandweacquireenough
compute).
To understand the result, let’s consider the special case where all work is a bottleneck. Propo-
sition 1 implies all work is automated, which means compute is used for all existing work. At this
point, we can write output (given an allocation of labor) as
𝑌𝑡 = max

for some 𝐴 > 0 equal to the rate of transformation of compute into output. To conclude, let’s

turn to labor. The allocation of labor that maximizes total resources assigns all labor of skill𝑠 to
arg max𝜔∈Ω𝛼(𝜔), which yields
𝑌𝑡 = 𝐴

.
These steps clarify the economic logic behind Proposition 2. AGI allows us to produce all
bottleneck work with compute. At this point, compute pins the value of work: having a worker
producingoneunitofwork 𝜔isthesameashaving 𝛼(𝜔)extraunitsofcompute,whichisthesame
as having𝐴𝛼(𝜔)units of output. The best thing labor can do is to specialize in the work that saves
themostcompute,whichfreescomputationalresourcescapableofgeneratinganoutput 𝐴CEU(𝑠).
The above reasoning must be modified slightly by the existence of accessory work. Accessory
work that is automated can be handled as above. If some accessory work is not automated, it is
because it is not worth wasting scarce compute on it. Suppose𝜔 is performed by workers of skill
𝑠 ∈𝒩 and not worth automating. Reallocating𝛼(𝜔)units of compute from producing bottlenecks
(valued at𝐴 𝛼(𝜔)) to producing𝜔 (valued at MPL(𝑠)—the marginal product of skill𝑠labor) must
lower output, which implies
𝐴𝛼(𝜔)> MPL(𝑠) ⇒ 𝐴CEU(𝑠)> MPL(𝑠).
This inequality shows that the value of accessory work performed by skill𝑠 labor is bounded by
𝐴CEU(𝑠)and must then eventually converge to an additive constant (this last claim is a nontrivial
implication of constant-returns to scale in𝐹).6
Proposition 2 shows how the automation of bottlenecks allows output to scale with compute,
sustaining economic growth.
Proposition 3.Output grows at the same rate as computing resources𝑄𝑡.
Thisprovidescauseforoptimism: InaworldofAGI,theeconomycangrowsimplybyexpanding
computational capabilities. No other form of technological progress is needed after AGI makes it
feasible to turn compute into all kinds of work. This is true even if there is accessory work left
unautomated, as this work does not hinder growth.
6A subtle detail behind the statement of Proposition 2 is that human workers fall in two groups. Workers of skill𝑠
forwhomoneelementof 𝜔∗(𝑠)isautomatedperformworkonlyin 𝜔∗(𝑠)andallsuchworkisautomated. Thisisgroup
𝒜. The remaining workers are group𝒩.

How is the growing income distributed? In a competitive economy, workers and compute are
paid their marginal contribution to output. These can be read right away from the expression for
output in Proposition 2.
Proposition 4.The real price of computing resources converges to𝐴and real wages to
𝑊(𝑠) =
 

𝐴CEU(𝑠) if 𝑠 ∈𝒜
𝐴CEU(𝑠) if 𝑠 ∈𝒩
In an AGI economy, workers are paid the value of the compute needed to replicate their work.
Human skill remains valuable—even in a world where all work is automated—because it can be
used to accomplish useful work, saving scarce computational resources. This hints at an important
distinction: AGI does not render labor redundant; it makes it replicable through computation.
Since compute is scarce, human labor retains value, given by the opportunity cost of deploying
computational resources.
Skills that perform accessory work command a discounted wage, in the sense thatCEU(𝑠)<
CEU(𝑠). Accessoryworklefttohumansisnotagrowingsourceofriches. Thereasonwhythiswork
isleftuntouchedisthatwealreadyhavetoomanyworkerstodoit. Thislowersitsvalue(hencethe
discount) and makes it impractical to automate it.
The significant result is that wages become fully decoupled from growth, which in the AGI
economy is entirely driven by expanding computing resources. Despite the fact that the economy
keeps expanding over time, the value of human labor stops growing and remains bounded above
by thevalue ofcompute neededto replicate it. Because wages remainbounded whilethe economy
continues to expand, all income eventually accrues to compute.
Proposition 5.The share of compute in GDP converges to 1 and the share of labor in GDP to zero.
The share of labor in GDP can be bounded by the share of human compute in our total compu-
tational resources, measured by
Share human compute𝑡 ≡

times 1015 −1018 flops. The value of total compute in the economy, on the other hand, could be as
high as1054 flops, making human compute meager in comparison. These calculations show that
in an AGI economy where labor paid its compute-equivalent value, the labor share will plummet,
as total compute is projected to far exceed human compute. Conversely, most if not essentiallyall
income will accrue to owners of computing resources.
The fact that the value of human labor remains capped and shrinks as a share of output does
not imply that AGI made society and workers poor in any sense. Adding up the income generated
by compute and human labor, society becomes richer (and keeps getting richer over time so long
as it expands computing resources!). Even if we leave aside the income accruing to compute, the
transition from the pre-AGI to the AGI economy necessarily makes labor income more valuable as
a whole.
Proposition 6. The sum of all people wages is higher in the limit with AGI than in the pre-AGI economy
(with𝑄𝑡 =0 and 𝛼𝑡(𝜔)=∞).
The proposition shows that workersas a wholebenefit from transitioning to the AGI economy.
Why? The arrival of AGI cannot make us worst off collectively, since we could always set up a
no-AGI zone and continue carrying our lives as if nothing had happened. This delivers at least the
same wages we had before.
The exact argument is as follows: competitive markets imply that the economy arranges pro-
duction efficiently under AGI. There is no rearrangement that can raise output. Suppose we take
1%ofhumanworkersandsendthemtoanon-AGIzone. Theseworkersproduce (𝑊pre-AGI·𝐻)×1%
in the non-AGI zone (an implication of constant-returns to scale), but we give up their wages
(𝑊post-AGI·𝐻)×1% inthepost-AGIworld. Becausethisrearrangementcannotraiseoutput,thecost
(𝑊post-AGI·𝐻)×1% exceedsthegains (𝑊pre-AGI·𝐻)×1% andwagesinthepost-AGIworldarehigher
than those in the pre-AGI one.
There are limits to the above argument. If the AGI economy uses some finite resource that is
also needed by human labor or there are diminishing returns to scale, the above argument breaks
down. Still, the above logic shows that the scope for AGI to make human workers collectively less
valuable is limited. The “problem” with AGI is that human labor seizes to be a source ofgrowing
riches, not that it looses value.
11
1.2 Transition to AGI [Preliminary]
In general, the transition from the current economy to the AGI limit is hard to trace and depends
on how fast compute advances (𝑄𝑡) relative to progress in AGI (the𝛼’s).
Tosimplifytheexposition,assumeallworkisabottleneckandiseventuallyautomated. Assume
also that𝛼𝑡(𝜔)jumps from infinity to its limit value𝛼(𝜔)at some finite time𝑇(𝜔).
Two polar cases stand out. On one extreme we have a transition where technology binds and
work𝜔 is automated at𝑇(𝜔), the exact moment it becomes feasible to do so. This means compute
is abundant and ready to be used in any bottleneck tasks that can be automated. On the other
extreme, we have a transition where compute binds and work𝜔 is only automated at a future date
˜𝑇(𝜔), once the economy acquires enough compute to justify this application.
Proposition 7.Suppose compute binds along the transition. The marginal value of compute𝐴𝑡 decreases
and converges monotonically to𝐴> 0. Moreover, for every skill𝑠:
1. The work inΩ(𝑠)is automated sequentially, from least to computational to highest computational
requirements.
2. Wages𝑊𝑡(𝑠)decreases gradually around˜𝑇(𝜔)at the same rate as𝐴𝑡 for an interval of time and then
continue growing until the next date is reached.
3. At the time work inarg max𝜔∈Ω𝛼(𝜔)is finally automated, wages𝑊𝑡(𝑠)must equal𝐴𝑡 CEU(𝑠)and
decrease gradually from there on at the same rate as𝐴𝑡.
As a whole, total wages weakly increase during the transition.
When compute binds, the transition to the AGI limit is smooth and gradual. For every skill
𝑠, wages are in general growing over time. This pattern is punctuated by short-lived episodes
aroundthetimesomeoftheworkperformedisautomated. Duringtheseevents,workersgradually
reallocate away from the automated work, which is eventually completely taken over by AGI. This
processcontinuesuntilonlyworkin arg max𝜔∈Ω𝛼(𝜔)remains. Oncethisworkisfinallyautomated,
workers are stuck here and their wages are pinned down by the value of compute they save. From
thereon,theirwagesdecreaseatthesamerateas 𝐴𝑡 untiltheyconvergetothevaluesinProposition
4. On net, this process generates a growing path for total wages, and no sharp declines or “jumps”
in the wage of workers.
12
Proposition 8.Suppose technology binds along the transition. The marginal value of compute𝐴𝑡 may be
non-monotonic and jump up at points during the transition before converging to𝐴. Moreover, for every skill
𝑠:
1. The work inΩ(𝑠)is automated at𝑇(𝜔).
2. Wages𝑊𝑡(𝑠)may jump down at𝑇(𝜔)for some of the𝜔 ∈Ω(𝑠)if displacement effects dominate.
3. Wages𝑊𝑡(𝑠)necessarily jump down when the last work inΩ(𝑠)is automated
4. Wages may exceed𝐴𝑡 ·CEU(𝑠)at various points in the transition.
As a whole, total wages may jump down at points during the transition and will otherwise increase.
When technology binds, the transition to the AGI limit is jagged, uncertain, and haphazard.
The proposition describes a world where compute is abundant and ready to be used the second an
application arrives. Technology firms are experimenting in the back with applications of AI. The
momentanapplicationpansout,thelabormarketisdisrupted,causingtheimmediatedisplacement
of some of the people working at the automated tasks. Those who happen to be employed in
applications that prove harder to automate, on the other hand, will see rising wages, far exceeding
what they will earn in the AGI limit. The flip-side is the looming realization that at some future
date,thishighwageswillevaporate,asthisisapremiumfortherandomfactthattheworktheydo
just happened to be the last experiment to pan out.
2 Scientific Work
Above I considered an economy where computers and people carry out the work needed for
production. Let’s now expand the analysis to account for scientific work. This type of work does
not deliver output, but expands our knowledge on how to produce more efficiently in the future.
The quantity of output produced is now
𝑌𝑡 = 𝑍𝑡 𝐹({𝑋𝑡(𝜔)}𝜔∈Ω),
where 𝑍𝑡 is the level of technological sophistication of the economy, improved by completing

scientific work. As in semi-endogenous growth models, this evolves according to

The quantity of scientific work accomplished in this economy is
𝑋𝑡(𝜎) = 𝐿𝑡(𝜎)+ 1
𝛼𝑡(𝜎)𝑄𝑡(𝜎).

The set of skills used for scientific work are assumed different from those used for production,
denoted by𝒮𝑃.
To simplify the exposition, assume all scientific and production work are bottlenecks.
The two premises above are now strengthened as follows:
Premise 1′(AGI for science). For all work𝜔 ∈Ωand scientific work𝜎 ∈Ξ, 𝛼𝑡(𝜔)and 𝛼𝑡(𝜎)converge to
some finite values𝛼(𝜔),𝛼(𝜎)∈( 0,∞)over time.
I also strengthen Premise 2 to:
Premise 1′(Exponential compute). 𝑄𝑡 grows exponentially at rate𝑔𝑄 > 0.
The next proposition characterizes the limit behavior of the economy. To highlight key forces,
14
I assume a constant fraction𝜆 of compute is allocated to science. Naturally, there is some optimal
value for𝜆that depends on how society discounts future consumption flows.
Proposition 9. Suppose fraction𝜆 ∈(0,1)of compute allocated to science. All production and scientific
bottlenecks are automated and output converges to

As before, aggregate production possibilities in the economy become additive in compute and
labor, with labor expressed in units of compute.
More novel, the stock of productive knowledge𝑍(𝑡)expands over time and scales with com-
puting resources. In standard semi-endogenous growth models,𝑍(𝑡)scales with population, since
scientific work requires human brains and these are limited by the size of the population. Here, by
contrast, 𝑍(𝑡)scales with the economy’s computational resources𝑄𝑡 because these can be used to
automate all scientific bottlenecks.
The fact that AGI makes it feasible to complete scientific work with compute generates a com-
pounded growth effect.

𝑔𝑌 =𝑔𝑄

The main difference with Proposition 3 is that, in an economy without other forms of scientific
progress, output scales with compute and𝑔𝑌 = 𝑔𝑄.The possibility of carrying out science with
compute implies that the growth rate is now higher by𝑔𝑄


. This is because some compute is
used to expand productive knowledge, which then raises the productivity ofall units of compute
employed in production, generating increasing-returns in compute𝑄𝑡.
The above results clarify that, even in an AGI world where compute can be used for science,
output scales with compute. There is not necessarily an intelligence or growth explosion, as this
15
requires an exploding amount of compute.
One interesting aspect has to do with the prioritization of compute across uses.
Proposition 11. Suppose the economy discounts future resources at a rate𝜌 ≥0. In order to maximize
welfare, in the long run, the economy allocates a fraction
𝜆∗ = 1
1 +𝛽+𝜌
of compute to science and the remaining to production. Along the transition, scientific bottlenecks are
prioritized and𝜆(𝑡)starts above𝜆∗, eventually converging to𝜆∗.
This result provides some guidance on how an efficient economy organized to maximize dis-
counted aggregate output would prioritize scarce compute.
In the short run, some priority should be given to scientific work, as this allows the rapid
expansionofproductionknowledge,whichmakestheeconomymoreproductiveatallfuturetimes.
Other considerations not accounted for here, such as minimizing labor-market disruptions along
the transition, call for even more prioritization of scientific work and a more gradual deployment
of AGI for production (see for example Lehr and Restrepo, 2022).
In the long run, compute is allocated to both uses, and the economy eventually automates all
productionandscientificbottlenecks. Thereasonisthatthisstrategyachievesthemaximumscaling
of output with compute. Using all compute for science yields a growth rate of

.
Using all compute for production yields a growth rate of
𝑔𝑌 = 𝑔𝑄.
Using compute for both types of bottlenecks yields a higher growth rate because it exploits the
increasing-returns to scale synergies between production and research introduced by scientific
progress.

3 Discussion
Thischapteranalyzedthelong-runimplicationsofAGIforproduction,growth,andlabormarkets.
The findings challenge both overly optimistic and overly pessimistic views about the future of
human labor. On one hand, human work does not become obsolete. Because compute remains
scarce,laborretainsvaluebysavingoncomputationalresources. Inaddition,someaccessorywork
may be left untouched by AGI, offering a stable, persistent set of roles for humans. On the other
hand, while humans can still contribute economically, their role shrinks dramatically. The work
that remains for people—whether bottleneck or accessory—commands a fixed value, bounded by
the compute required to replicate it. In a growing economy, this means wages stagnate and the
labor share collapses. Even skilled workers performing essential tasks will earn only what they
save in compute—no more. In sum: humans can still work in an AGI economy—so long as they
are endowed with time and skill—but their contribution becomes economically negligible. The
economy keeps growing; we stay in place.
An interesting implication is the potential persistence of unautomated accessory work. For
many socially intensive tasks—such as care work, hospitality, or therapy—the compute required
to emulate human warmth or social intuition may be enormous. Even if such work is technically
automatable, it may remain economically impractical to do so. As a result, these domains could
continue to offer meaningful work for people. Yet these roles, while important, are not a source of
growingincome. Thewagestheyofferarecapped,possiblytradedatadiscount,andunresponsive
to aggregate growth. Accessory work may provide continuity and stability in a transforming
economy, but are not a source of growing riches providing human labor a central economic role.
The transition to AGI also presents distinct challenges. If the bottleneck is technological—i.e., if
thekeyconstraintisdevelopingAGIsystemsthemselves—theninequalitymayrisesharplyduring
the transition, as certain types of labor temporarily gain extraordinary value. From the viewpoint
of workers, the transition will feel uncertain and even unfair. People with some skills may see
their wages fall rapidly to their compute-equivalent levels while others, by a sheer act of luck, may
see their wages rise above it, earning a large premium just because the work they do turned out
to be among the last we figured how to automate. This feels harder to navigate than a transition
where compute binds, and wage growth is punctuated by gradual declines and the gradual need
to reallocate labor. One crucial question here is how to help workers navigate a transition where
17
technology binds. How can we help them share risks? Would other policies such as deploying the
technology gradually help here (see also Lehr and Restrepo, 2022)?

returns broadly shared.
Looking beyond wages and output, AGI also raises deeper questions about meaning and pur-

stopped working, no one would notice. In the AGI economy, we won’t be missed.
Would people still choose to work, even when it makes no difference? Would work remain
meaningful when it ceases to be economically essential? Or would we stop working altogether,
not because we were replaced, but because we chose to step aside—seeking fulfillment in a world
where our skills no longer matter?
