      Restrepo models an economy where artificial general intelligence (AGI) can execute every economically valuable task using compute. The core result: once compute can cover all growth-bottleneck work, output is paced purely by how fast compute expands, not by the number of people available. Production shifts from multiplicative (labor√ócompute) to additive once AGI clears the bottlenecks, so extra labor no longer multiplies output.</p>
    <p class="text-xs panel-muted leading-relaxed">
      The chapter separates work into bottleneck tasks that cap growth and accessory tasks that can be dropped without slowing progress. As AGI absorbs the bottlenecks, wages track the compute cost of reproducing human effort and labor's share of GDP trends toward zero, even though some people keep working in accessory roles.</p>

      <p class="font-semibold">Plain-language explainer</p>
      <p class="panel-muted">Imagine a factory where robots can do every critical step so long as you feed them enough electricity. Humans stick around only when it's cheaper to pay someone than to spin up more compute, or when the task is optional anyway. Restrepo's model shows how that world rewrites wage setting, profit shares, and growth forecasts.</p>
