      GDPval assembles 1,320 deliverables drawn from 44 occupations that together represent the majority of global GDP, then pairs expert baselines with
      frontier model outputs graded blindly by practitioners. The benchmark tracks win-rate head-to-heads rather than static scores, surfacing whether
      AI assistance is starting to match specialists on consequential work.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed panel-muted">
      The results show GPT-5 and Claude Opus 4.1 already tying or beating experts on roughly half of the gold-standard tasks, with reasoning effort,
      scaffolding, and human review lifting outcomes without changing the underlying model. GDPval therefore acts as an operational early-warning signal
      for when knowledge-work automation becomes economically material.

      <p class="panel-muted">Think of GDPval as a giant portfolio review: real consultants, designers, analysts, and lawyers submit the work they would hand clients, and models are given the same brief. Graders compare the two blindly so teams can see when AI assistants start delivering human-grade results and what oversight still matters.</p>

      GDPval stress-tests AI models on 1,320 real deliverables drawn from 44 high-value occupations. Frontier models now win or
      tie against experts on roughly half of the gold subset, especially when workflows layer in extra reasoning, prompt scaffolding,
      and human review. Treat GDPval as an early warning system for when knowledge-work automation becomes economically material.
