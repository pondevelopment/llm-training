      This paper introduces a Bayesian Item Response Theory framework to quantify human-AI synergy, separating individual ability from collaborative ability while controlling for task difficulty. Applied to 667 users across math, physics, and moral reasoning tasks, it finds GPT-4o boosts human performance by 29 percentage points and Llama-3.1-8B by 23pp. Crucially, collaborative ability is distinct from solo ability—users with stronger Theory of Mind achieve superior AI collaboration without improving solo performance.

      <p class="panel-muted">Working with AI is like playing doubles tennis: your individual skill matters, but so does knowing when to pass the ball to your partner. The authors show that people who naturally consider the AI's "perspective" get better answers—even if they're not the strongest solo players.</p>

      Current AI benchmarks evaluate models in isolation, ignoring how they perform when collaborating with actual humans. This creates a measurement gap: a model that scores high on MMLU might still frustrate users, while a "weaker" model might deliver better real-world outcomes. This framework closes that gap by quantifying synergy—the performance boost AI provides to diverse users on varying tasks—enabling rigorous model comparisons beyond static prompt accuracy.

      <li><strong>Dual ability framework reveals hidden dynamics:</strong> Solo ability (&theta;) and collaborative ability (&kappa;) are empirically distinct (&Delta;ELPD = 50.9, p &lt; 0.001), explaining why high-IQ users sometimes struggle with AI tools.</li>
      <li><strong>Complementarity beats equalization:</strong> GPT-4o provides 29pp boost while Llama-3.1-8B provides 23pp, with higher-ability users performing best overall but lower-ability users seeing larger relative gains.</li>
      <li><strong>Theory of Mind predicts synergy:</strong> Users who better infer the AI's "mental state" achieve superior collaboration (&rho;<sub>s</sub> = 0.17, p &lt; 0.001), and moment-to-moment ToM fluctuations predict AI response quality.</li>

      <h4 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Why Item Response Theory for human-AI evaluation</h4>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">
        Standard benchmarks report aggregate accuracy, but this confounds task difficulty, user ability, and AI capability. IRT untangles these: it estimates latent difficulty for each task and latent ability for each user, then measures how much AI shifts the ability distribution. The Bayesian shrinkage approach prevents overfitting and provides uncertainty estimates around synergy claims.

      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">
        ToM predicts human-human collaboration because it enables communication repair and ambiguity resolution. The authors find that both stable ToM traits and within-dialogue fluctuations predict AI response quality, meaning collaboration skill is not just intelligence—it's perspective taking.

      This framework shifts AI evaluation from "How accurate is the model?" to "How much does the model improve human performance?" Organizations deploying AI assistants should adopt synergy benchmarks as a core procurement and training metric.

      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">
        Start with domain-specific task batteries spanning easy/medium/hard difficulty. Run a within-subjects design where each user completes half the tasks solo and half with AI. Track correctness, time, and confidence, then fit the IRT model from the paper to estimate &theta;, &kappa;, &beta;, and &gamma;. Repeat quarterly to monitor learning effects and model drift.
