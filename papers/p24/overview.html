      Randomized experiment (n=52 developers) shows AI assistance impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities when learning a new programming library&mdash;reducing quiz scores by 17% (Cohen&rsquo;s d=0.738, p=0.010)&mdash;without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Identifies six distinct AI interaction patterns; three that preserve learning involve sustained cognitive engagement.

      <p class="panel-muted">Imagine learning to drive with a chauffeur doing everything for you: you arrive at your destination, but you never learned the route. This paper shows the same happens when developers lean on AI to write code for a new library. Those who let AI do the work finished the task but scored far worse on a comprehension test afterward. The exception? Developers who used AI to ask questions and check their own understanding&mdash;they kept both speed and learning.</p>

      AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence. In a controlled coding experiment, developers using a GPT-4o&ndash;powered assistant completed tasks at similar speed to those without AI but scored 17% lower on a post-task quiz covering the new library&rsquo;s concepts. The cost is invisible: teams see equivalent throughput but accumulate a hidden skill deficit, particularly in debugging&mdash;the very ability needed to supervise AI-generated code.

      <li><strong>No free lunch on productivity:</strong> AI assistance did not significantly speed up task completion (p=0.391), partly because participants spent up to 11 minutes composing queries during a 35-minute task</li>

        Organizations rolling out AI coding assistants should consider the hidden cost of accelerated onboarding: new engineers may ship code without developing the mental models needed to maintain it. Designing AI-assisted workflows that preserve learning is a governance question, not just a tooling one.

      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">
        Control-group developers encountered a median of 3 errors per task versus 1 for the AI group. More importantly, Trio-specific errors (RuntimeWarning for unawaited coroutines, TypeError for passing coroutine objects) forced the control group to develop deep library-level understanding. Since AI-assisted developers rarely hit these errors, they never built the debugging mental models tested in the evaluation. The largest quiz score gap occurred precisely on debugging questions&mdash;the skills most critical for supervising AI-generated code in production.

        AI assistance creates a learning paradox: the productivity it offers comes at the cost of the very skills needed to supervise its output. The effect persists across all experience levels (1&ndash;3 years through 7+ years of coding).

      <li><strong>Sample &amp; design:</strong> 52 professional developers (26 per group), balanced on coding experience (1&ndash;3, 4&ndash;6, 7+ years), Python frequency, and prior asyncio usage; $150 flat compensation; pre-registered at osf.io/w49e7</li>
      <li><strong>Primary finding:</strong> AI group scored 17% lower on comprehension quiz (mean difference 4.15/27 points, Cohen&rsquo;s d=0.738, p=0.010); effect survived warm-up time covariate (d=0.725, p=0.016)</li>
      <li><strong>Productivity null result:</strong> No significant time difference between groups (p=0.391); AI condition slightly faster on average but offset by query-composition overhead (up to 11 min of 35 min)</li>
      <li><strong>Skill-specific breakdown:</strong> Largest score gap on debugging questions, smallest on code reading; control group encountered 3&times; more Trio-specific errors (median 3 vs 1)</li>
      <li><strong>Interaction heterogeneity:</strong> AI Delegation pattern finished fastest (19.5 min) but scored lowest (39%); Conceptual Inquiry scored highest (86%) at similar speed to control (24 min)</li>
      <li><strong>Query analysis:</strong> 79 explanation queries, 51 generation queries, 9 debugging queries across 25 participants; 4 of 8 lowest scorers used AI exclusively for code generation</li>
      <li><strong>Pilot validation:</strong> 4 pilot studies (n=186 total) established non-compliance rates, refined quiz design to eliminate local item dependence, added syntax hints to isolate Trio-specific learning</li>
      <li><strong>Self-report convergence:</strong> Control group reported higher self-reported learning; AI group rated the task as easier but quiz as equally difficult</li>

      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">
        The three high-scoring patterns share a common trait: developers maintained cognitive ownership of the problem. Practically, this means (1) asking for explanations before or alongside code, (2) manually adapting generated code rather than copy-pasting, and (3) resolving at least some errors independently. Organizations can encode these into workflow defaults&mdash;e.g., AI assistants that default to &ldquo;explain first, generate on request&rdquo; during onboarding. The paper notes that agentic coding tools, which require even less human participation, would likely amplify the skill-formation penalty.

      <li>Replicate with agentic coding tools (Cursor agent, Copilot Workspace) where query composition overhead is eliminated&mdash;expect larger skill deficits</li>

      <li>Test whether &ldquo;learning mode&rdquo; AI interfaces (explanation-first, concept check-ins) close the skill gap without sacrificing throughput</li>
