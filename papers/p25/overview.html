        Kerr’s classic essay catalogs how teams celebrate metrics that are easy to count while quietly hoping for
        harder-to-measure behaviors. Unless rewards and reviews match the real mission, organizations reliably get more
        of the wrong behavior—no matter how inspiring the strategy slide looks.

      <li>People optimise for the incentives that actually trigger bonuses, promotions, or public praise.</li>

      <li>Fixes start with making implicit trade-offs explicit, then redesigning rewards to buy the outcomes you want.</li>

        Treat Kerr’s framework as a diagnostic when OKR or KPI programs drift. It reveals when dashboards, quarterly
        targets, or performance reviews reward busywork while leaders “hope” for long-term health, quality, or ethics.

      <p>
        Run a quarterly workshop where each VP lists their top three desired behaviors and the actual rewards attached
        (bonuses, dashboards, shout-outs). Map mismatches on a heatmap, assign owners to redesign the reward, and track
        leading indicators (quality audits, renewal uplift, cycle times) after the change.

        Rewards that contradict stated goals do more damage than no reward at all—they legitimise counter-productive

        Leaders must design incentive systems deliberately—even anecdotally—because employees will assume incentives
