      Kerr catalogues the perverse incentives that arise when organisations benchmark what is easy to count&mdash;test
      scores, budget adherence, body counts&mdash;while publicly hoping for harder-to-measure behaviours like learning,
      strategic patience, or ethical conduct. The essay demonstrates how reward systems dictate culture regardless of
      leadership intent.

      Kerr's classic essay catalogs how teams celebrate metrics that are easy to count while quietly hoping for
      harder-to-measure behaviors. Unless rewards and reviews match the real mission, organizations reliably get more
      of the wrong behaviorâ€”no matter how inspiring the strategy slide looks.

      <li><strong>People optimise</strong> for the incentives that actually trigger bonuses, promotions, or public praise.</li>

        Run a quarterly workshop where each VP lists their top three desired behaviors and the actual rewards attached
        (bonuses, dashboards, shout-outs). Map mismatches on a heatmap, assign owners to redesign the reward, and track
        leading indicators (quality audits, renewal uplift, cycle times) after the change.

        Rewards that contradict stated goals do more damage than no reward at allâ€”they legitimise counter-productive
        habits while shielding leaders from the truth.

        Leaders must design incentive systems deliberatelyâ€”even anecdotallyâ€”because employees will assume incentives
