    <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed panel-muted">GDPval is a benchmark of 1,320 multimodal, expert-authored tasks covering 44 occupations across the nine largest U.S. GDP sectors. Frontier models are graded head-to-head against seasoned professionals, letting teams track how close automation is to high-value knowledge work. The contributing experts averaged roughly 14 years of experience and priced each task using Bureau of Labor Statistics wages so savings estimates reflect real compensation.</p>
    <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed panel-muted">
      The results show GPT-5 and Claude Opus 4.1 already tying or beating experts on roughly half of the gold-standard tasks, with reasoning effort,
      scaffolding, and human review lifting outcomes without changing the underlying model. GDPval therefore acts as an operational early-warning signal
      for when knowledge-work automation becomes economically material.

      GDPval shows that top-tier multimodal models are nearing parity with human professionals on well-scoped digital work. Claude Opus 4.1 and GPT-5 already match or beat expert deliverables on roughly half of tasks when humans review outputs, and simple scaffold upgrades unlock further gains. The signal: automation will land first where tasks are document-centric, reference-heavy, and already digitized.

      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 text-sm panel-muted space-y-1">
        <li>Two domain experts grade each deliverable blindly against the human reference using a three-part rubric covering competence, instruction fidelity, and presentation polish.</li>

        <li>All graders work from standardized scoring guides and shared attachment checklists to balance nuance with comparability.</li>
