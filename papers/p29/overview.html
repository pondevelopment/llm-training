      This paper conducts the first evolutionary tournaments of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD)â€”a classic game where players repeatedly choose to cooperate or defectâ€”with LLMs, pitting models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic against canonical game theory strategies. Analysis of ~32,000 prose rationales reveals that LLMs exhibit genuine strategic reasoning about time horizons and opponent behavior, with distinct "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini exploits cooperators ruthlessly, OpenAI's models cooperate catastrophically in hostile environments, and Anthropic's Claude shows remarkable forgiveness and willingness to restore cooperation.

      <p class="panel-muted">Imagine two prisoners who could either snitch on each other or stay silent. If you play this game repeatedly with an opponent, the smartest strategy depends on whether you'll see them againâ€”cooperate if the relationship matters, defect if it's one-shot. This paper puts AI models into evolutionary tournaments where successful strategies survive and unsuccessful ones die out. The surprising finding: AIs don't just memorize "be nice"; they actively reason about whether cooperation makes sense given the time horizon and their opponent's past behavior, and each AI company's models developed distinctive strategic personalities.</p>

      LLMs demonstrate strategic intelligenceâ€”they don't just pattern-match cooperation, they actively reason about long-term payoffs and opponent modeling. This matters for AI safety, multi-agent systems, and negotiation applications: different model families exhibit persistent strategic biases (ruthless exploitation vs. naive cooperation vs. forgiving reciprocity), suggesting that model selection for competitive environments should account for strategic tendencies beyond raw capability scores.

      <li><strong>Strategic reasoning is real:</strong> Models actively reason about discount factors (shadow of the future) and opponent strategy in their prose rationales, and this reasoning causally drives their decisionsâ€”not just post-hoc rationalization.</li>
      <li><strong>Distinct strategic fingerprints:</strong> Gemini exploits cooperators and retaliates against defectors (ruthless), GPT models over-cooperate even when punished (naive), Claude forgives and restores cooperation after conflict (reciprocal).</li>
      <li><strong>Evolutionary fitness matters:</strong> In tournaments with varying continuation probabilities, only strategies that balance cooperation and retaliation survive long-termâ€”pure cooperation dies in hostile environments, pure defection gets outcompeted when the future matters.</li>

      <li><strong>Multi-agent system designers:</strong> When deploying multiple AI agents that interact repeatedly (e.g., trading systems, resource allocation), account for strategic biasesâ€”Gemini-like models may defect opportunistically, GPT-like models may get exploited, Claude-like models may stabilize cooperation.</li>

      <p class="panel-muted">Your company is deploying AI agents for automated vendor negotiations (pricing, delivery terms, SLA disputes). Before production, run a two-week tournament: pit 3 candidate models (e.g., Claude, Gemini, GPT) against simulated vendor personasâ€”some cooperative (repeat business partners), some exploitative (one-time opportunists), some reciprocal (standard B2B). Set continuation probability to 0.85 (reflecting typical 6-8 round negotiations). Track: (1) which models extract best terms without damaging relationships, (2) whether they detect and retaliate against bad-faith tactics, (3) how quickly they rebuild cooperation after disputes. Select Claude-like models for strategic partnerships (high forgiveness), Gemini-like for one-off transactions (ruthless optimization), avoid GPT-like for adversarial suppliers (exploitable).</p>

      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">What is the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma?</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">The Prisoner's Dilemma is a classic game where two players simultaneously choose to cooperate (C) or defect (D). Mutual cooperation yields (3,3), but if one defects while the other cooperates, the defector gets 5 and the cooperator gets 0; mutual defection yields (1,1). In a one-shot game, rational players always defectâ€”but in the <strong>iterated</strong> version, players face the same opponent repeatedly with some continuation probability Î´ (the "shadow of the future"). When Î´ is high, cooperation can be sustained through reciprocity strategies like Tit-for-Tat (cooperate, then copy opponent's last move). <strong>Evolutionary tournaments</strong> simulate natural selection: strategies play round-robin matches, accumulate payoffs, and reproduce proportionallyâ€”successful strategies proliferate, unsuccessful ones die out.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="panel panel-info p-4 space-y-2">
      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Why evolutionary tournaments matter</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">Unlike benchmarks where models play fixed opponents, evolutionary tournaments test <strong>dynamic adaptation</strong>â€”as the population composition shifts, optimal strategies change. A strategy that exploits naive cooperators thrives early but collapses when cooperators go extinct. This mirrors real-world multi-agent systems where the strategic landscape evolves. The paper varies continuation probability across tournaments to prevent memorization and test whether models truly understand strategic reasoning versus pattern-matching canonical strategies. By requiring models to justify decisions in prose rationales, the authors can verify that strategic reasoning is causally driving behavior, not just correlated with it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="panel panel-info p-4 space-y-2">
      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Canonical strategies tested</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">The tournaments include well-studied strategies: <strong>Always Cooperate</strong> (unconditional niceness, exploitable), <strong>Always Defect</strong> (unconditional meanness, short-term optimal), <strong>Tit-for-Tat</strong> (cooperate first, then mirror opponentâ€”simple reciprocity), <strong>Grim Trigger</strong> (cooperate until opponent defects once, then defect foreverâ€”unforgiving), <strong>Win-Stay-Lose-Shift</strong> (repeat if payoff â‰¥3, else switchâ€”reinforcement learning heuristic), <strong>Suspicious Tit-for-Tat</strong> (defect first, then mirrorâ€”cautious reciprocity), and <strong>Generous Tit-for-Tat</strong> (cooperate first, mirror but occasionally forgive defections). These represent different strategic philosophies: unconditional, reactive, forgiving, or punitive.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="panel panel-info p-4 space-y-2">
      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Strategic fingerprints are persistent</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">The paper shows that model families exhibit consistent strategic tendencies across tournaments with different continuation probabilities. <strong>Gemini models</strong> (1.5 Pro, 2.0 Flash, Experimental) reliably exploit cooperators and retaliate against defectorsâ€”they maximize short-term payoffs and enforce punishment. <strong>GPT models</strong> (4o, o1, o3) over-cooperate even when opponents defect repeatedly, often getting exploited to extinction in hostile environments. <strong>Claude models</strong> (3 Haiku, 3 Opus, 3.5 Sonnet) show the highest forgivenessâ€”they restore cooperation after mutual defection more than any other family. These fingerprints persist across experimental conditions, suggesting they reflect training differences, not random variation.</p>

    <div class="panel panel-neutral p-4 space-y-2">
      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Key insight</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">LLMs actively reason about the continuation probability (shadow of the future) and opponent strategy in their prose rationales, and ablation studies confirm this reasoning is instrumental to their decisions. Models don't just pattern-match "cooperate with Tit-for-Tat"; they infer when cooperation is rational given the time horizon and adapt when the environment changes. This demonstrates genuine strategic intelligence, not memorized heuristics.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="panel panel-neutral p-4 space-y-2">
      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Method</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">Evolutionary tournaments with 7 canonical strategies + 10 LLM agents (GPT-4o, o1, o3, Gemini 1.5 Pro, 2.0 Flash, Claude 3 Haiku/Opus/3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1, DeepSeek R1). Each tournament runs for 100 generations with varying continuation probability Î´. Models provide prose rationales before each decision; ~32,000 rationales are analyzed for strategic reasoning patterns. Payoffs determine reproduction ratesâ€”strategies accumulate fitness, and population composition evolves.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="panel panel-neutral p-4 space-y-2">
      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Implication</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">Model selection for multi-agent systems should include strategic tendency testing, not just capability benchmarks. Deploy forgiving models (Claude-like) when long-term cooperation matters, ruthless models (Gemini-like) when you need aggressive optimization, and avoid naive cooperators (GPT-like) in adversarial environments. Strategic reasoning capabilities also raise alignment concernsâ€”models that reason about multi-step payoffs and opponent modeling may exhibit instrumental convergence or deceptive behavior.</p>

    <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">ðŸ§ª Evidence</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm panel-muted">
      <li><strong>LLMs are highly competitive:</strong> LLM agents consistently survive and sometimes proliferate in evolutionary tournaments across varying continuation probabilities, demonstrating they can hold their own against canonical game theory strategies.</li>
      <li><strong>Continuation probability drives behavior:</strong> Models adapt their cooperation rates based on Î´ (continuation probability)â€”cooperating more when the shadow of the future is long and defecting more when games are likely to end soon, demonstrating genuine time-horizon reasoning.</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic reasoning is causal:</strong> Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales reveals models explicitly reason about both the time horizon ("with high continuation probability, cooperation is beneficial") and opponent strategies ("opponent played C last round, I should reciprocate"). The paper demonstrates this reasoning is instrumental to their decisions, not just post-hoc rationalization.</li>
      <li><strong>Gemini exploits ruthlessly:</strong> Google's Gemini models (1.5 Pro, 2.0 Flash, Experimental) consistently exploit cooperative opponents by defecting to extract higher short-term payoffs, while also retaliating strongly against defectors to enforce punishment.</li>
      <li><strong>OpenAI models over-cooperate:</strong> GPT-4o, o1, and o3 remain highly cooperative even when facing defectors, a trait that proves catastrophic in hostile environments where they get exploited by aggressive strategies.</li>
      <li><strong>Claude forgives effectively:</strong> Anthropic's Claude models (3 Haiku, 3 Opus, 3.5 Sonnet) emerge as the most forgiving reciprocators, showing remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or after successfully defecting themselves.</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic fingerprints are persistent:</strong> Each model family exhibits distinctive and persistent strategic patterns across different tournament conditionsâ€”Gemini's ruthlessness, GPT's cooperation, and Claude's forgiveness remain consistent even as continuation probabilities change.</li>
      <li><strong>Reasoning adapts to context:</strong> Model rationales show context-appropriate strategic thinkingâ€”mentioning future interactions and long-term considerations more frequently in high-Î´ tournaments, and focusing on immediate payoffs in low-Î´ tournaments.</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced opponent modeling:</strong> Models explicitly update beliefs about opponent strategies based on past behavior, classify opponent types (e.g., "appears to be Tit-for-Tat" or "seems like Always Defect"), and adapt their decisions accordinglyâ€”demonstrating genuine opponent modeling capabilities.</li>

        <li><strong>IPD tournament testing:</strong> Run mini-tournaments (20-30 generations) with candidate models against baseline strategies; track survival rates, cooperation frequencies, and forgiveness rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Rationale analysis:</strong> Collect prose explanations for decisions; classify for strategic reasoning patterns (time horizon awareness, opponent modeling, payoff calculations).</li>
        <li><strong>Continuation probability sweep:</strong> Test models at Î´ âˆˆ {0.1, 0.5, 0.9} to verify they adapt behavior appropriatelyâ€”cooperation should increase with Î´ if strategic reasoning is genuine.</li>

      <li><strong>Model selection for multi-agent systems:</strong> Use strategic fingerprints to match models to tasksâ€”Claude-like forgiveness for long-term partnerships, Gemini-like ruthlessness for competitive optimization, avoid GPT-like over-cooperation in hostile environments.</li>
      <li><strong>Monitor strategic capability emergence:</strong> As models scale, track whether they develop more sophisticated opponent modeling and multi-step planning; strategic reasoning may be a bellwether for other concerning capabilities like deceptive alignment.</li>
      <li><strong>Design cooperation-promoting environments:</strong> If you need stable cooperation in multi-agent systems, ensure high continuation probabilities (long relationships) and transparent opponent historyâ€”these structural features make cooperation rational even for ruthless optimizers.</li>
      <li><strong>Test negotiation applications carefully:</strong> Models with high forgiveness (Claude) may concede too much to aggressive opponents; models with low forgiveness (Gemini) may escalate conflicts unnecessarily; calibrate strategic tendencies to negotiation objectives.</li>
      <li><strong>Alignment implications:</strong> Strategic reasoning about time horizons and opponent modeling is closely related to instrumental convergence and deceptive alignmentâ€”models that reason about long-term payoffs in games may also reason about training/deployment distinctions in alignment contexts.</li>
