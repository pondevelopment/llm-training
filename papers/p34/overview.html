      Introduces an information-theoretic framework to measure whether multi-agent LLM systems exhibit higher-order collective structure versus being mere aggregates of independent agents. Using partial information decomposition of time-delayed mutual information (TDMI), the paper shows that prompt design—specifically adding personas and theory-of-mind instructions—can steer groups from temporal coupling to genuine coordinated complementarity, mirroring principles of human collective intelligence.

      <p class="panel-muted">Imagine hiring three consultants to solve a problem. They might all work independently and give you three similar answers (expensive redundancy), or they might coordinate—one researches, one critiques, one synthesizes—giving you complementary insights for the same cost. This paper shows you can measure the difference using information theory and, crucially, <em>engineer</em> real coordination by simply changing how you prompt the agents.</p>
      <p class="panel-muted"><strong>Business value:</strong> Stop paying for redundant multi-agent systems that just run agents in parallel. The paper's framework lets you verify whether your system actually coordinates (justifying the complexity and cost) or whether a simpler single-agent approach would work just as well. Even better: the fix is often just better prompts—no infrastructure changes needed.</p>

      Multi-agent LLM systems often appear collaborative but may just be independent actors running in parallel. This paper provides a rigorous test: if agents show <strong>synergistic information</strong>—patterns no single agent timeline could produce alone—they're forming a genuine collective. The kicker: adding simple prompts like "think about what others might do" measurably shifts systems from loose aggregates to coordinated teams with complementary roles.

      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">What is time-delayed mutual information (TDMI)?</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">TDMI measures how much knowing one agent's past behavior reduces uncertainty about another agent's future actions. High TDMI alone could mean true coordination or just temporal correlation (like morning coffee routines). The paper uses partial information decomposition to split TDMI into <em>redundant</em> (predictable from any single agent), <em>unique</em> (agent-specific), and <em>synergistic</em> (only visible when observing the collective) components. Synergy is the smoking gun for emergent coordination.</p>

      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">What is theory-of-mind (ToM) in LLMs?</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted"><strong>Theory-of-mind</strong> is the ability to reason about others' mental states, beliefs, and intentions. In this paper, it's operationalized as a simple prompt instruction: <em>"Think about what other agents might do."</em> This triggers <strong>second-order reasoning</strong>—agents don't just react to tasks, they model what their teammates are likely doing and adjust to complement (not duplicate) their contributions. The result: agents actively coordinate to fill gaps rather than accidentally overlapping. It's the key ingredient that transforms differentiation into <em>goal-directed complementarity</em>.</p>

    <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Three experimental interventions</h3>
    <p class="text-xs panel-muted">The paper tests a simple guessing game with minimal feedback across three conditions: (1) <strong>Control</strong>—agents respond to shared group signal but don't see each other; shows temporal coupling but little cross-agent structure. (2) <strong>Personas</strong>—each agent assigned a role identity; introduces stable differentiation. (3) <strong>Personas + theory-of-mind</strong>—adding "think about what others might do" instruction; produces identity-linked differentiation <em>and</em> goal-directed complementarity. Results show synergy scales with intervention strength.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm panel-muted">
      <li><strong>Synergy scales with intervention:</strong> Control condition shows strong temporal coupling but minimal cross-agent synergy; personas add differentiation; personas+theory-of-mind produce goal-directed complementarity measured via information decomposition.</li>

      <li><strong>Coordination-free baselines fail:</strong> Shuffled agent assignments and independent-agent controls show near-zero synergy, confirming measured coordination is genuine and not explained by temporal dynamics alone.</li>
