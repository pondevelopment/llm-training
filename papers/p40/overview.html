      Quantifies GenAI's causal impact on firm productivity through seven large-scale randomized field experiments (millions of users, 6 months) at a leading cross-border e-commerce platform. Sales increased 0–16.3% depending on workflow, with gains mapping directly to total factor productivity improvements. The four positive applications generate approximately $5 per consumer annually. Primary mechanism: higher conversion rates (1–22% increases), not cart sizes—GenAI reduced marketplace frictions and expanded the market rather than extracting more from existing buyers.

      <p class="panel-muted">Imagine testing seven ways to improve a grocery store: better signage (search), product descriptions, automated customer service, personalized flyers, etc. You run controlled experiments where half the customers experience each improvement. Some changes drive big sales lifts (16% for customer service chatbots), others moderate (2–3% for better descriptions), and some have no effect (Google ads). The wins come from making shopping easier—more people complete purchases—not from each shopper spending more. Smaller stores and newer customers benefit most, because they had the biggest friction problems to begin with.</p>

      This study delivers what executives have been asking for: large-scale, causal evidence that GenAI investments translate into measurable revenue and productivity gains. Seven randomized experiments across customer service, search, content generation, and advertising workflows show 0–16.3% sales increases, with an aggregate $5 per consumer annual value at early-stage adoption. These are demand-side gains—higher conversion rates expanding the market—not cost savings. The heterogeneity pattern (smaller sellers and newer buyers see larger lifts) signals where to prioritize deployment and suggests competitive advantages may fade as adoption spreads industry-wide.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 text-sm panel-muted space-y-1">
      <li><strong>Workflow-dependent gains:</strong> Pre-sale chatbots (+16.3%), search refinement (+2–3%), product descriptions (+2–3%), push messages (positive), ads (0%). Effect size depends on GenAI's marginal contribution vs. existing baseline.</li>
      <li><strong>Conversion-driven mechanism:</strong> Sales increases stem from 1–22% higher conversion rates (and click-through where applicable), not increased spending per buyer. GenAI reduces frictions—information asymmetry, search costs, personalization gaps—rather than extracting more value per transaction.</li>
      <li><strong>Heterogeneity as strategic signal:</strong> Smaller/newer sellers and less experienced consumers capture disproportionate gains. This "skill-leveling" effect implies: (a) target early deployment where baseline capabilities are weakest, (b) first-mover advantages may compress as competitors adopt.</li>

      <li><strong>C-suite / Investors:</strong> Addresses the "$600B question" raised by Sequoia and others: can GenAI deliver ROI? $5/consumer annual value represents 5.5–6% of 2023–2024 global e-commerce per-user revenue growth. Early-stage adoption with 20× API growth (2024→2025) and expanding from 7 to 60+ workflows suggests compounding effects, though equilibrium dynamics (industry-wide adoption offsetting competitive advantages) remain uncertain.</li>
      <li><strong>Product / Operations leaders:</strong> Not all workflows benefit equally—advertising saw zero effect while customer service drove 16.3% lifts. Prioritize GenAI deployment where: (a) baseline capability is weak (no chatbot → 24/7 AI agent), (b) manual processes bottleneck scale (product descriptions for millions of SKUs), (c) heterogeneity is high (new users need more hand-holding). Track conversion rates, not just engagement metrics.</li>
      <li><strong>Data science / ML teams:</strong> Field experimental evidence shows constant-input productivity gains—no labor/capital changes, fixed prices. This validates GenAI as a TFP enhancer via demand-side value creation. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that friction-reduction mechanisms amplify in segments with lower baseline capabilities, informing model fine-tuning and deployment targeting strategies.</li>
      <li><strong>Strategy / Competitive intelligence:</strong> The platform scaled from ~7 GenAI applications (2023) to 60+ (2025), with 20× API growth.

      <p class="panel-muted">An online marketplace operator considering GenAI adoption could replicate this study's approach: (1) <strong>Workflow audit:</strong> Identify 5–10 consumer-facing workflows (customer service, search, recommendations, content generation). Rank by baseline capability (e.g., "no chatbot" vs. "ML-powered search"). (2) <strong>Controlled pilot:</strong> Randomize users to GenAI-enhanced vs. baseline versions for 30–90 days, ensuring constant prices and inputs. (3) <strong>Metric instrumentation:</strong> Track sales value (primary), conversion rates, engagement (clicks, session duration), and satisfaction surveys. Calculate treatment effects with confidence intervals. (4) <strong>Heterogeneity drill-down:</strong> Segment by seller size/experience and buyer tenure. If gains concentrate in low-capability segments, scale deployment there first. (5) <strong>Aggregate value projection:</strong> Annualize workflow-specific lifts, multiply by user base, compare to GenAI infrastructure costs (API calls, fine-tuning, engineering).

      <h4 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Why conversion rates reveal the mechanism</h4>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">Conversion rate = (buyers / visitors). Sales can increase via two margins: <strong>extensive</strong> (more buyers) or <strong>intensive</strong> (higher spending per buyer). This study found 1–22% conversion increases with no effect on average cart values, isolating the extensive margin. GenAI didn't upsell or cross-sell existing buyers—it reduced frictions (better search, richer descriptions, instant support) that previously stopped visitors from completing purchases. This "market expansion" pattern differs from cost-cutting productivity gains and signals GenAI's value in consumer-facing workflows: making the platform easier to use rather than extracting more from each transaction.</p>

      <h4 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">The friction-reduction mechanism</h4>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">Digital platforms already mitigate marketplace frictions (Belleflamme & Peitz, 2021), but this study shows GenAI can further compress them. <strong>Information asymmetry:</strong> AI-generated product descriptions and instant chatbot responses reduce uncertainty about quality and fit. <strong>Search costs:</strong> Query refinement and translation lower the effort to find relevant products across languages. <strong>Personalization gaps:</strong> Automated push messages and optimized ads close targeting inefficiencies at scale. The heterogeneity pattern (smaller sellers, newer buyers benefit more) confirms friction-reduction: participants with the weakest baseline capabilities—least product information, highest search costs, lowest platform familiarity—capture the largest gains.</p>

        <h4 class="font-semibold text-heading mb-2">🔑 Key insight</h4>
        <p class="text-body">GenAI drives total factor productivity gains through <em>demand-side value creation</em>—higher sales with constant inputs/prices—not cost savings. The 0–16.3% sales increases map directly to TFP improvements because labor, capital, and prices remained fixed. This represents a departure from typical productivity research emphasizing supply-side efficiency (faster task completion, fewer workers). Revenue-based productivity from enhanced consumer experience is an underexplored channel in the GenAI literature.</p>

      <div>
        <h4 class="font-semibold text-heading mb-2">🔬 Method</h4>
        <p class="text-body">Seven randomized field experiments (Sept 2023–June 2024) across distinct business workflows: customer service, search, content generation, advertising, seller services. User groups ranged from tens of thousands to tens of millions. Treatment: GenAI-enhanced workflow. Control: firm's standard pre-GenAI practice (ranging from no support to ML-based algorithms to human input). Key: randomization at user/product level, minimal cross-experiment overlap (&lt;1%), constant inputs and prices. Granular transaction data enabled heterogeneity analysis across seller/buyer segments.</p>

The platform expanded from ~7 GenAI applications (2023) to 60+ (2025), with 20× API growth—suggesting learning curves and compounding potential. Long-run effects depend on: (a) workflow complementarities (do multiple GenAI enhancements amplify each other?), (b) equilibrium forces (industry-wide adoption eroding competitive advantages), (c) organizational adaptation (integration with human workflows). The heterogeneity pattern (gains concentrate in low-capability segments) implies first-mover advantages may fade as laggards adopt.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 text-sm panel-muted space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Pre-Sale Service Chatbot:</strong> 16.3% sales increase (largest effect). Baseline: no customer support. GenAI: 24/7 AI agent responding to idiosyncratic multilingual inquiries. Mechanism: 22% higher conversion rate, addressing the critical friction of unanswered pre-purchase questions.</li>
      <li><strong>Search Query Refinement:</strong> 2–3% sales lift. Baseline: standard ML-based search algorithms. GenAI: understanding, refining, translating queries to improve consumer-product matching. Mechanism: higher click-through and conversion rates by decoding latent demand behind multilingual searches.</li>
      <li><strong>Product Description Generation:</strong> 2–3% sales increase. Baseline: nearly half of products had no or limited descriptions. GenAI: comprehensive, structured, market-localized descriptions. Mechanism: reduced information asymmetry, higher conversion rates through better product presentation.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing Push Messages:</strong> Positive effect (granular data not disclosed). Baseline: limited personalization at scale. GenAI: generating millions of customized messages. Mechanism: precision targeting closing personalization gaps for hundreds of millions of users.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Advertising Titles & other ad workflows:</strong> 0% effect (no detectable impact). Suggests GenAI's marginal contribution varies by baseline strength—when existing ML or human processes are already effective, GenAI augmentation may not move the needle.</li>
      <li><strong>Chargeback Defense:</strong> 15% higher success rate. Baseline: over half of disputes unaddressed by sellers due to complexity, language barriers, regulatory diversity. GenAI: one-stop automated solution streamlining cross-border chargeback processes.</li>
      <li><strong>Live Chat Translation:</strong> 5.2% increase in consumer satisfaction. GenAI: real-time multilingual translation integrated into customer service. Mechanism: enabling native-language support for diverse consumer base, reducing communication friction.</li>
      <li><strong>Aggregate annual value:</strong> Approximately $5 per consumer across the four workflows with positive, measurable effects. Represents roughly 5.5–6% of global e-commerce per-user revenue growth between 2023 and 2024. Given the platform's scale (hundreds of millions of users), this translates to substantial absolute value even at early adoption.</li>
      <li><strong>Scaling trajectory:</strong> Platform expanded from ~7 GenAI applications (2023) to 40+ (2024) to 60+ (2025), with API calls to LLMs growing 20× between 2024 and 2025. Rapid adoption suggests both technical feasibility and perceived value, though long-run productivity effects depend on complementarities and competitive dynamics.</li>
      <li><strong>Heterogeneity concentration:</strong> Conversion rate increases ranged 1–22% across workflows. Smaller and newer sellers experienced disproportionately larger gains, as did less experienced consumers. Consistent with friction-reduction mechanism: GenAI disproportionately helps participants with lower baseline capabilities.</li>

      This paper provides an empirical playbook for measuring GenAI's ROI in consumer-facing workflows. The key lesson: effect sizes are workflow-dependent, ranging from 0% (ads) to 16.3% (chatbots), driven by GenAI's marginal contribution relative to existing baselines. Before deploying GenAI across your organization, map your current workflows, prioritize those with weak baselines or high friction, and run controlled experiments to quantify gains and heterogeneity. Track conversion rates—not just engagement—as the primary indicator of friction reduction and market expansion.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 text-sm text-body space-y-1">
      <li><strong>Workflow audit and prioritization:</strong> Inventory your consumer-facing workflows (customer service, search, recommendations, content, messaging). Rank by baseline capability (e.g., "no chatbot" scores highest for GenAI potential). Focus pilots on workflows with weak baselines or manual bottlenecks—the paper shows GenAI adds most value where existing solutions are limited.</li>
      <li><strong>Instrumentation for causal measurement:</strong> Design A/B tests randomizing users to GenAI-enhanced vs. baseline workflows. Hold inputs (labor, capital) and prices constant so sales changes isolate productivity effects. Track sales (primary), conversion rates, engagement (clicks, session duration), and satisfaction. Calculate treatment effects with confidence intervals; expect heterogeneity across user segments.</li>
      <li><strong>Heterogeneity deep-dive:</strong> Segment results by seller size/experience and buyer tenure. If gains concentrate in low-capability segments (smaller sellers, newer buyers), prioritize deployment there—but recognize that competitive advantages may compress as laggards adopt. Use heterogeneity insights to guide model fine-tuning (e.g., optimize GenAI for first-time user flows).</li>
      <li><strong>Mechanism diagnosis:</strong> Distinguish conversion rate gains (market expansion via friction reduction) from cart size increases (upselling/cross-selling). If conversion drives the effect (as in this study), GenAI's value proposition is making the platform easier to use. If cart size increases, you're extracting more from existing buyers—a different ROI story. Tailor GenAI strategy accordingly.</li>
      <li><strong>Complementarity and equilibrium analysis:</strong> After validating individual workflow gains, assess whether multiple GenAI applications amplify each other (complementarities) or substitute (diminishing returns). Model long-run effects under industry-wide adoption: if competitors deploy similar GenAI, will gains persist or compress due to competitive dynamics? Factor equilibrium erosion into NPV calculations—the paper's $5/consumer estimate is a <em>static</em>, early-stage figure.</li>
