    Field study of 25,000 Danish workers across 11 AI-exposed occupations finds widespread chatbot adoption (83% with employer encouragement) and modest productivity gains (2.8% time savings), yet <strong>precisely estimated zero effects</strong> on earnings, hours, and wages—with confidence intervals ruling out impacts >1%. Pass-through from productivity to pay is only 3–7%, challenging narratives of imminent labor market transformation from Generative AI.

      <strong>Think of it like:</strong> A factory introduces a new tool that helps workers finish individual tasks 3% faster on average. But because workers can't easily negotiate raises for these small gains, aren't using the tool constantly throughout the day, and managers haven't reorganized workflows around it, nobody's paycheck actually changes. The tool is everywhere, but the economic impact is invisible.

  <p class="text-sm text-body">
    Despite massive hype and rapid adoption, AI chatbots have had <strong>zero measurable impact</strong> on worker earnings 1.5 years after ChatGPT's launch—even as 83% of encouraged workers use them and report time savings. The ceiling isn't technical limitations; it's that modest productivity gains (2.8% average) barely pass through to wages (3–7% elasticity) in real-world labor markets. Track <em>actual earnings changes</em> in your workforce, not just adoption metrics or self-reported productivity, to assess GenAI ROI.

    <li><strong>Zero wage effects:</strong> Difference-in-differences estimates rule out earnings impacts >1% on average, >6% by occupation—despite 47% baseline adoption rising to 83% with encouragement</li>
    <li><strong>Weak pass-through:</strong> Only 3–7% of reported time savings translate to earnings; 97% of workers report no pay change from AI chatbots as of November 2024</li>
    <li><strong>Modest real gains:</strong> Users save 2.8% of work hours on average (vs. 15–50% in RCTs), reflecting limited applicability, lack of complementary investments, and occupational heterogeneity</li>

    <li><strong>C-suite/Investors:</strong> GenAI investments may not deliver near-term returns—stock gains from ChatGPT announcement haven't materialized in workforce productivity or cost savings. Budget for 3–5 year horizons, not quarters.</li>
    <li><strong>HR/Total Rewards:</strong> No evidence workers capture productivity gains through compensation—merit cycles and promotion velocity unaffected. Chatbot access isn't creating retention or attraction pressure yet.</li>
    <li><strong>Product/Engineering:</strong> Even with 38% of firms deploying custom models and 30% training employees, productivity gains remain <3%. Success requires workflow redesign, not just tool deployment.</li>

    <p class="text-sm text-body">
      <strong>Context:</strong> 200-person sales and customer success org considering \$360K annual investment in GitHub Copilot for engineers + custom chatbot for support (\$30/user/month). CFO wants ROI model based on 20% productivity gains from vendor case studies.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-body">
      <strong>Reality check from this paper:</strong> Use 3% time savings (not 20%) and 5% wage pass-through (not 100%). Realistic annual benefit: 200 workers × \$80K avg salary × 3% productivity × 5% pass-through = \$24K in avoided hiring/OT costs. At \$360K investment, breakeven requires 15× larger effects than Denmark field data shows. Instead: (1) pilot with 20 engineers for 6 months, (2) measure <em>actual</em> ticket closure rates and deploy frequency (not self-reported productivity), (3) track whether high-usage teams ship features with fewer engineers, (4) gate full rollout on demonstrated 10%+ output gains in controlled setting. Budget this as R&D exploration, not margin expansion.

    <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Key insight</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-body">
      AI chatbot adoption has been worker-driven and rapid (47% baseline, 83% with encouragement), but labor market rigidities, weak bargaining power for bottom-up tool adoption, and limited workflow integration create a massive gap between <em>tool usage</em> and <em>economic outcomes</em>.

  <div class="panel panel-neutral p-4 space-y-2">
    <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Method</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-body">
      Two-wave survey (Nov 2023, Nov 2024) of 25,000 workers at 7,000 workplaces across 11 AI-exposed occupations in Denmark, linked to monthly administrative earnings/hours data. Difference-in-differences comparing adopters vs. non-adopters before/after ChatGPT launch (Nov 2022), leveraging employer policies as quasi-experimental variation.

  <div class="panel panel-neutral p-4 space-y-2">
    <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Implication</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-body">
      GenAI's labor market impact is occurring on a much longer timescale than technology adoption curves suggest. Organizations investing in chatbots should expect years-long productivity J-curves, not quarters. Measure actual output changes (deals closed, tickets resolved, features shipped) rather than adoption rates or sentiment.

    <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Understanding the RCT vs. field gap</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-body">
      Randomized controlled trials consistently show 15–50% productivity gains from AI chatbots (e.g., Noy & Zhang: 37% for writing tasks; Brynjolfsson et al.: 15% for customer support; Peng et al.: 58% for coding). This study finds only 2.8% real-world time savings. Three factors explain the gap:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm text-body">
      <li><strong>Limited applicability:</strong> Users apply chatbots every 3rd-4th day and spend only 5–6% of work hours actively using them, even on usage days</li>
      <li><strong>Occupational heterogeneity:</strong> RCTs focus on high-impact tasks (support tickets, copywriting, code completion); broader occupations (teachers, accountants, financial advisors) see half the gains</li>
      <li><strong>Lack of complementary investment:</strong> RCTs provide ideal conditions (workflow integration, clear use cases, training); real workers rarely have these supports unless employers actively encourage use</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="panel panel-info p-4 space-y-2">
    <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Why weak pass-through matters</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-body">
      In competitive labor markets, workers' productivity gains should pass through 1:1 to wages (Becker 1964). This study finds only 3–7% pass-through, closer to firm-level productivity shocks (Card et al. 2018: 5–15%) than worker-specific skill gains (Balke & Lamadon 2022: 26%). Three mechanisms:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm text-body">
      <li><strong>Principal-agent frictions:</strong> Bottom-up adoption without managerial buy-in weakens workers' ability to claim credit or negotiate raises based on chatbot-assisted output</li>
      <li><strong>Task vs. output gains:</strong> Saving time on <em>existing tasks</em> doesn't increase <em>marginal productivity</em> unless workflows adapt to assign more valuable work—which rarely happens without employer coordination</li>
      <li><strong>Monopsony power:</strong> Workers face search frictions and switching costs; employers capture most of the surplus from productivity improvements, especially for general-purpose tools workers can't easily credential</li>
    </ul>

  </header>

  <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm text-body">
    <li><strong>Adoption surge with firm support:</strong> Baseline adoption 47% (no encouragement) rises to 83% when employers encourage use, with daily usage jumping from 8% to 21%. Gender gap in adoption narrows from 12pp to 5pp with encouragement, 3.6pp with training.</li>
    <li><strong>Precise zeros on earnings:</strong> Difference-in-differences estimates for log earnings show no significant effects (β = 0.001, CI ruling out |effects| > 1%), with no differential trends over 18 months post-ChatGPT. Same pattern for hours worked and hourly wages.</li>
    <li><strong>Modest time savings:</strong> Users report average 2.8% reduction in work hours, ranging from 0.6% (teachers without encouragement) to 6.8% (marketing professionals with encouragement). 80% reallocate time to other tasks, <10% to leisure.</li>
    <li><strong>Weak wage pass-through:</strong> Workers' self-reported earnings impacts (Nov 2024) average 0.04–0.2%, closely matching administrative data. Only 3–7% of time savings translate to earnings, with 97% of workers reporting zero pay change.</li>
    <li><strong>No firm-level effects:</strong> Workplaces with high vs. low adoption rates (20pp SD after measurement error correction) show no differential changes in total employment, wage bills, or retention. Effects remain zero across all 11 occupations.</li>

  </header>
  
  <p class="text-sm text-body">
    If you're investing in GenAI for productivity gains, this evidence suggests a 3–5 year horizon before labor market impacts materialize. Focus on workflow transformation, not tool distribution.
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm text-body">
    <li><strong>Measure output, not usage:</strong> Track deals closed per sales rep, tickets resolved per support agent, features shipped per sprint—not chatbot session counts or NPS scores. Denmark data shows 83% adoption with zero earnings effects.</li>
    <li><strong>Invest in complementary redesign:</strong> Time savings in encouraged workplaces (5–7% for marketing, software dev) are 2–3× higher than non-encouraged (2–3%), but still need workflow changes to capture gains. Co-develop new processes alongside tool rollout.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't model immediate cost savings:</strong> Zero effects on wage bills and employment through 18 months means GenAI shouldn't reduce headcount budgets in FY26 planning. Budget as capability building (R&D) rather than efficiency play (COGS reduction).</li>
    <li><strong>Test pass-through in your context:</strong> Run pilots with clear productivity metrics (output per FTE) and track whether high performers using chatbots command higher comp or faster promotions. If not, investigate whether principal-agent frictions or task misalignment is blocking value capture.</li>
    <li><strong>Expect heterogeneity by role:</strong> Customer support, marketing, and software development show 2–3× larger gains than teaching, accounting, finance. Prioritize occupations with repetitive, generative tasks over those requiring deep domain expertise or high factual accuracy.</li>
