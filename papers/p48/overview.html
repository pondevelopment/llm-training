      Proposes a comprehensive research agenda for understanding AI's distinct effects in organizations through <strong>four business capabilities</strong>: automation, engagement, insight/decision-making, and innovation. Unlike prior digital technologies, AI can constrain, complement, or substitute for humans, fundamentally challenging divisions between human ability and machine capability while exhibiting complexity that creates dual outcomes requiring multi-stakeholder perspectives.

      <p class="panel-muted">AI differs from spreadsheets or databases: it can learn from mistakes, display emotions, make autonomous decisions, and even create new products. This creates organizational tensions (Should we automate jobs or augment them? Who's accountable when algorithms fail?) that span automation replacing work, chatbots engaging customers, machine learning informing decisions, and algorithms generating innovations—each requiring distinct research approaches.</p>

      AI technologies shift the locus of action, choice, and control away from exclusive human domain, requiring new frameworks to understand human-AI interaction. The paper identifies <strong>10 core tensions</strong> across 4 capabilities (automation: 2 tensions; engagement: 2 tensions; insight: 4 tensions; innovation: 2 tensions) that define the IS research landscape. For practitioners deploying AI: understand which capability you're targeting, anticipate the specific tensions it will invoke, and adopt multi-stakeholder governance to avoid unintended consequences.

    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-xs panel-muted">
      <li><strong>Framework structure:</strong> 4 capabilities × 10 total tensions = distinct research domains. Automation (substitution vs tasks, automation vs augmentation), Engagement (humanlike vs machinelike conversation, human vs emotion AI), Insight (decision accountability, human vs machine bias, rationality vs judgment, learning vs myopia), Innovation (exploration vs exploitation, credit allocation)</li>
      <li><strong>Distinct from prior IT:</strong> AI's learning, emotional display, creativity, and autonomous decision-making enter domains previously exclusive to humans, creating tensions absent in traditional systems (ERP, CRM, knowledge management)</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-stakeholder requirement:</strong> Dual outcomes (productivity gains + workforce deskilling, fraud detection + algorithmic discrimination) vary greatly among stakeholders—decoupling any group from design/implementation often leads to system failure</li>

      <li><strong>Chief Information Officers:</strong> Framework provides diagnostic tool for anticipating organizational disruption. Each AI capability invokes specific tensions (e.g., RPA triggers automation vs augmentation decisions). Map current AI initiatives to capabilities, identify anticipated tensions, establish governance for each.</li>
      <li><strong>Product/Engineering Leaders:</strong> Anthropomorphism trade-offs in conversational AI, explainability requirements for ML-driven decisions, and credit allocation for algorithm-generated innovations require explicit design choices. Framework helps teams anticipate downstream organizational effects of technical decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>HR/Organizational Development:</strong> Automation doesn't eliminate occupations but reconfigures tasks, power structures, and knowledge flows. Framework highlights areas requiring workforce reskilling (e.g., translators for AI insights, coordinators for human-robot teams) and cultural adaptation (trust in black-box decisions, accountability for algorithmic errors).</li>
      <li><strong>Risk/Compliance Officers:</strong> Each tension creates distinct ethical/legal exposure: bias in hiring algorithms (insight capability), emotion manipulation in chatbots (engagement capability), deskilling through over-automation (automation capability).

        <p><strong>Context:</strong> Bank deploys AI across four capabilities:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-0.5">
          <li><strong>Loan processing</strong> (automation: RPA for document verification)</li>
          <li><strong>Customer service</strong> (engagement: chatbot for account inquiries)</li>
          <li><strong>Credit decisions</strong> (insight: ML algorithm for loan approval)</li>
          <li><strong>Product development</strong> (innovation: algorithmic identification of new customer segments)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Each capability creates distinct tensions:</strong> RPA triggers job displacement concerns (substitution vs augmentation), chatbot anthropomorphism causes trust oscillation (humanlike vs machinelike), credit ML raises fairness questions (human vs machine bias), and algorithmic segmentation challenges traditional R&D roles (credit allocation).</p>

        <ol class="list-decimal ml-5 space-y-0.5">
          <li>Map each AI initiative to capability category</li>
          <li>Identify primary tension for that capability (e.g., credit ML → decision accountability)</li>
          <li>Establish capability-specific governance (explainability requirements for ML, emotional boundaries for chatbot, retraining programs for RPA)</li>
          <li>Create cross-capability coordination (ensure RPA workers can interpret chatbot escalations, ML teams can validate algorithmic innovations)</li>

        <p><strong>Expected outcome:</strong> Systematic tension management prevents common failures (e.g., chatbot deployed without anthropomorphism guidelines causing customer confusion; ML credit system deployed without explainability causing regulatory violations; RPA implemented without retraining causing workforce resistance). Multi-stakeholder engagement throughout design/deployment avoids decoupling that leads to system failure.</p>

      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Why AI differs from prior digital technologies</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">
        Traditional IT (databases, ERP, CRM) primarily automated structured processes and captured transactions without learning or autonomy. AI technologies differ in three fundamental ways that create new organizational challenges:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-xs panel-muted">
        <li><strong>Learning and adaptation:</strong> ML algorithms self-improve from data, shifting control from programmers to training datasets. This creates path dependencies, bias amplification, and black-box opacity absent in rule-based systems</li>
        <li><strong>Capability expansion into human domains:</strong> Emotion recognition, creativity, autonomous decision-making, conversation—tasks previously exclusive to humans. Creates ambiguity in accountability, trust, and authority</li>
        <li><strong>Dual outcomes requiring multi-stakeholder governance:</strong> Productivity gains for firm + workforce deskilling for employees; fraud detection for customers + algorithmic discrimination for applicants. Impact varies among stakeholders, requiring inclusive design to avoid failure</li>

        Each capability serves distinct organizational function and invokes specific tensions requiring tailored research approaches:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-xs panel-muted">
        <li><strong>Automation (physical robots, RPA, ML):</strong> Tensions: substitution vs augmentation of work. Research: human-machine coordination, deskilling, power reconfigurations, workarounds</li>
        <li><strong>Engagement (chatbots, conversational AI, emotion AI):</strong> Tensions: humanlike vs machinelike interaction, emotion manipulation. Research: anthropomorphism effects, trust dynamics, ethical boundaries</li>
        <li><strong>Insight/Decisions (ML, deep learning, expert systems):</strong> Tensions: decision accountability, human vs machine bias, rationality vs judgment, learning vs myopia. Research: explainability, transparency, governance, long-term cognitive effects</li>
        <li><strong>Innovation (generative AI, algorithmic R&D):</strong> Tensions: exploration vs exploitation, credit allocation. Research: creativity augmentation, authorship rights, incentive structures</li>

    </header>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-xs panel-muted">
      <li><strong>Automation: tasks vs occupations:</strong> Most occupations have tasks replaceable by AI, but no occupation has all tasks replaceable (Brynjolfsson et al., 2018). Robots expected to rise from 10% to 25% of manufacturing tasks by 2025 (Sirkin et al., 2015). RPA in sales displaced account managers but elevated data scientists (Pachidi et al., 2020).</li>
      <li><strong>Engagement: anthropomorphism effects:</strong> Humanlike chatbot features (social presence, delay, humor) increase conversion rates (Schanke et al., in press) but can trigger oscillation effect where users alternate between treating bot as human and probing its limits, causing negative consequences (Brahnam, 2009).</li>
      <li><strong>Insight: bias and accountability:</strong> ML court systems predicting recidivism show racial bias (Daugherty & Wilson, 2018); hiring algorithms discriminate against women in STEM (Dastin, 2018). Clinicians doubt AI diagnostic recommendations, spending time decrypting recommendations rather than improving performance (Lebovitz et al., 2019).</li>
      <li><strong>Innovation: data dependency:</strong> ML requires abundant training data, favoring exploitation over exploration. Domains with limited data or requiring novelty depend on tacit knowledge difficult to digitize (Nonaka & von Krogh, 2009). Credit allocation ambiguity: algorithms can't hold copyright; programmers/owners receive authorship of AI creations.</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-stakeholder requirement:</strong> Organizations that decouple stakeholders from AI design/implementation face system failure (Wright & Schultz, 2018). Crowd data generation requires increasing organizational resources for declining data quality (Selander & Jarvenpaa, 2020).</li>

    <p class="text-xs panel-muted">
      This framework provides a structured approach for anticipating and managing AI's organizational effects. Rather than treating AI as monolithic, map initiatives to capabilities and anticipate capability-specific tensions requiring distinct governance approaches.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-xs panel-muted">
      <li><strong>Capability mapping audit:</strong> Inventory current/planned AI initiatives. Classify each by primary capability (automation, engagement, insight, innovation). For each, identify the primary tension it invokes (e.g., RPA → automation vs augmentation; chatbot → humanlike vs machinelike; credit ML → decision accountability). Prioritize governance development for high-risk tensions.</li>
      <li><strong>Establish capability-specific governance:</strong> Automation: retraining programs, human-in-the-loop policies for critical tasks, coordination mechanisms for human-robot teams. Engagement: anthropomorphism guidelines, emotional boundary policies, transparency about bot vs human agents. Insight: explainability requirements, bias audits, accountability protocols for algorithmic errors. Innovation: credit allocation policies, IP ownership for AI-generated outputs, data sourcing strategies.</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-stakeholder engagement from design through deployment:</strong> Identify all affected stakeholder groups (employees whose tasks are automated, customers interacting with engagement AI, decision-makers relying on insights, R&D teams using innovation AI). Establish participatory design processes, regular feedback loops, and transparent communication about AI capabilities/limitations. Avoid decoupling any stakeholder group to prevent system failure.</li>
      <li><strong>Monitor for dual outcomes and unintended consequences:</strong> Track both intended benefits (productivity, cost reduction, decision speed) and unintended harms (deskilling, algorithmic discrimination, eroded trust, path dependencies). Establish mechanisms for stakeholders to report issues. Create remediation protocols for detected harms (algorithm retraining, explainability enhancements, task rebalancing).</li>
      <li><strong>Cross-capability coordination:</strong> As organizations deploy multiple AI capabilities simultaneously, ensure coordination across domains. Example: RPA workers need to understand chatbot escalations; ML teams need to validate algorithmic innovations; emotion AI insights should inform human-robot coordination strategies. Create cross-functional AI governance team representing all capabilities to avoid siloed management creating blind spots.</li>
