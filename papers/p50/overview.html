      The authors studied 85 professionals in accounting and law firms responding to AI adoption (2018–2020). Rather than AI ending the professions, professionals engaged in <strong>intertwined boundary work</strong>—four interdependent modes (defending, creating, negotiating, coalescing) linked by opportunity and necessity ties—reconfiguring their work, expanding into advisory services, collaborating with technologists, and reshaping partnerships to maintain professional status while exploiting AI's capabilities.

      <p class="panel-muted">Imagine accountants and lawyers protecting their turf as AI takes over document review. Instead of just resisting, they play strategic chess: relinquish routine data work (defending), claim new AI-powered advisory services (creating), bring in tech experts as partners (negotiating), and reshape their firms to give technologists real power (coalescing). Each move enables the next—that's intertwined boundary work.</p>

      When AI disrupts professional work, isolated defensive moves fail. Accounting and law professionals succeeded by linking four boundary work modes: defending preserves judgment-based work while relinquishing data tasks; creating exploits AI insights to expand advisory domains; negotiating bridges to technologists who operate AI systems; coalescing redefines partnerships to empower those technologists. The interdependencies (opportunity ties enabling expansion, necessity ties requiring collaboration) transform threat into strategic advantage.

    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm panel-muted">
      <li><strong>Opportunity ties:</strong> Adjusted claims (defending) create openings to define new domains (creating) by positioning AI as augmentation tool.</li>
      <li><strong>Necessity ties:</strong> New advisory work (creating) requires technologist collaboration (negotiating) and partnership reform (coalescing) to succeed.</li>
      <li><strong>Recursive reinforcement:</strong> Later changes consolidate earlier ones—technologist partners strengthen the boundary bridging that enabled advisory expansion.</li>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm text-body">
      <li><strong>Strategic adaptation:</strong> Don't just defend existing work—link defensive moves to expansion opportunities; map how each boundary shift enables the next.</li>
      <li><strong>Inter-professional collaboration:</strong> AI adoption requires new roles (data scientists, AI specialists); plan career paths and partnership models before deployment, not after.</li>
      <li><strong>Organizational redesign:</strong> Technologists need real authority (partnership, management roles) to sustain AI-enabled services; flat structures beat hierarchies when adoption depends on cross-functional collaboration.</li>
      <li><strong>Service innovation:</strong> AI-generated insights enable advisory pivots (compliance → consulting); revenue models shift from hourly billing to value-based consulting.</li>

      <p class="font-semibold text-heading">Derivative example (patterned on the paper's law firm case)</p>
      <p class="panel-muted">A mid-sized consulting firm adopts AI contract analysis. Step 1 (defending): Junior consultants stop manual review, seniors emphasize strategic judgment. Step 2 (creating): AI insights enable proactive risk advisory service. Step 3 (negotiating): Data scientists join client meetings. Step 4 (coalescing): Firm creates "Principal" titles for non-consultants, giving data scientists partnership-level authority. Each step depends on the previous—isolated changes would fail.</p>

      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Key insight</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">Boundary work modes don't happen in isolation. Professionals protect interests through <em>intertwined</em> changes where defending enables creating (opportunity tie), which necessitates negotiating and coalescing (necessity ties), which recursively reinforce earlier moves. The interdependencies—not individual tactics—sustain professional status during disruption.</p>

      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">AI doesn't end professions—it reconfigures them. Organizations adopting AI need holistic change strategies that anticipate cascading boundary shifts. Isolated interventions (just training, just hiring data scientists) fail because they miss the interdependencies that make adaptation succeed.</p>

  <!-- Evidence -->
  <section class="panel panel-neutral p-5 space-y-3">
    <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">🧪 Evidence</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm panel-muted">
      <li><strong>Four modes observed:</strong> Defending (adjusting/restating claims to preserve judgment work), creating (defining new advisory domains), negotiating (boundary bridging to technologists), coalescing (redefining partnership exclusions).</li>
      <li><strong>Opportunity tie:</strong> Adjusted claims legitimating AI use for data tasks enabled expansion into advisory services that combine AI insights with professional judgment—wouldn't work without the defending move first.</li>
      <li><strong>Necessity tie (defending → negotiating):</strong> New role division required technologists to configure AI systems—boundary bridging became necessary, not optional, for advisory work to succeed.</li>
      <li><strong>Necessity tie (negotiating → coalescing):</strong> Technologists' central role in service delivery required partnership reform—couldn't sustain collaboration if they lacked authority or remained "non-professionals."</li>
      <li><strong>Recursive reinforcement:</strong> Technologist partners gained legitimacy to manage processes, consolidating boundary bridging; new advisory domains further justified adjusted claims about AI's role.</li>
      <li><strong>Context:</strong> AI tools (Kira, InFlo, Mindbridge) automated document review, audit sampling, contract analysis—tasks previously done by junior professionals—enabling data-driven advisory services.</li>
      <li><strong>Organizational impact:</strong> Partnerships now include data scientists, project managers, innovation officers without professional qualifications; career paths and governance models evolving to accommodate non-professional partners.</li>

    <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">🔭 For your roadmap</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm text-body">
      <li>Map boundary work interdependencies before AI deployment—identify which defensive claims enable expansion opportunities and which collaborations become necessary.</li>
      <li>Design career paths for AI specialists alongside domain experts—plan partnership/authority models that give technologists real influence, not just support roles.</li>
      <li>Anticipate recursive effects—early moves (like relinquishing routine work) shape what's possible later (like advisory pivots); sequence changes strategically.</li>
      <li>Monitor for necessity ties—if new services require cross-functional collaboration, organizational redesign (flatter structures, shared decision-making) becomes mandatory, not optional.</li>
      <li>Avoid isolated interventions—training programs, hiring data scientists, or technology pilots fail when they don't account for cascading boundary shifts across defending/creating/negotiating/coalescing.</li>
