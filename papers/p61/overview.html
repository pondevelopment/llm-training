      Field experiment with 450 remote workers reveals that when AI usage is visible to evaluators, workers reduce reliance on AI recommendations by 14%, causing a 3.4% drop in performance. Workers fear that heavy AI reliance signals a lack of confidence in their own judgment, a concern that persists even when evaluators are explicitly instructed to prioritize accuracy.

      <p class="panel-muted">Imagine you have a calculator, but you do all the math in your head because you're afraid using the calculator makes you look <strong>insecure</strong> or like you <strong>lack confidence</strong> in your own judgment. This paper proves workers sacrifice performance to signal "confidence" to their bosses.</p>

      The biggest barrier to AI adoption might not be technical skill or trust, but <strong>social signaling</strong>. Employees believe that using AI signals low ability or low confidence. When their usage is visible to managers, they actively avoid the tool to protect their professional image, even if it means doing worse work.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm panel-muted">
      <li><strong>The Visibility Penalty:</strong> AI adoption drops by <strong>14%</strong> simply by making usage visible to a supervisor.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance Cost:</strong> This "image management" leads to a <strong>3.4% decrease</strong> in task performance because workers ignore accurate AI advice.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration Loss:</strong> The signaling friction causes <strong>1 in 4</strong> potential successful AI collaborations to fail.</li>
      <li><strong>The "Confidence" Signal:</strong> Workers correctly intuit that observers view AI reliance as a sign of low confidence, creating a rational (but costly) incentive to go solo.</li>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm text-body">
      <li><strong>For HR & Culture:</strong> If your culture values "effort" and "process" over outcomes, you are discouraging AI use. You must explicitly decouple performance reviews from "how" the work got done.</li>
      <li><strong>For Managers:</strong> Be aware that your team might be hiding their AI use (or avoiding it) to impress you. Explicitly state that "using the best tool" is a sign of competence, not weakness.</li>
      <li><strong>For Tool Deployment:</strong> "Private" AI tools (where usage isn't logged/visible to peers) may see faster initial adoption than "Public" tools where every prompt is scrutinized.</li>

        <p class="font-semibold text-heading">Derivative example: The "Junior Analyst" Dilemma</p>
        <div class="panel-muted space-y-2">
          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A junior analyst is asked to write a market summary. They have access to an LLM that can do it in 5 minutes.</p>
          <p><strong>The Fear:</strong> "If I turn this in after 5 minutes, my boss will think I didn't work hard. If I say I used AI, they'll think I don't know the market."</p>
          <p><strong>The Result:</strong> The analyst spends 4 hours writing it manually to "prove" their worth, wasting company time.</p>
          <p><strong>The Fix (per paper):</strong> Make AI use <strong>private</strong> (reduce visibility) or explicitly reframe AI reliance as <strong>"adaptability"</strong> rather than dependency. Embedding AI as a default workflow step also removes the signaling risk.</p>

      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">The Result</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">Adoption plummeted in the "visible" group. Workers were willing to sacrifice accuracy (and their bonus) just to avoid looking dependent on the algorithm.</p>

      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">It's not about laziness. It's about <strong>signaling</strong>. Workers believe (often correctly) that "going solo" signals high confidence and expertise.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm text-body">
      <li><strong>Reframe the signal:</strong> Explicitly communicate that using AI is a sign of "adaptability" and "resourcefulness," not weakness.</li>
      <li><strong>Reduce visibility:</strong> Make AI usage logs private by default to lower the social stakes of experimentation.</li>
      <li><strong>Embed the tool:</strong> Integrate AI as a mandatory step in the workflow (e.g., "Review AI draft") so usage is no longer a discretionary signal of confidence.</li>
