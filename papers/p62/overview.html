      This paper proposes a lifecycle-aware taxonomy of harms for large language models, spanning what can go wrong
      before deployment (data, labor, environment), at generation time (bias, toxicity, hallucination), through misuse
      (jailbreaks, fraud), and into system-level and downstream impacts (elections, labor markets, high-stakes decisions).
      It also argues for layered mitigations and “dynamic auditing” (continuous monitoring) rather than one-time safety checks.

      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 panel-muted">
        <li><strong>Pre-deployment:</strong> training-data privacy/consent issues, labor harms in annotation, environmental/resource costs.</li>

        <li><strong>Societal/systemic:</strong> election manipulation and discourse dilution, economic disruption, compute/access inequalities.</li>

      <p class="panel-muted"><strong>Example harm chain:</strong> a privacy-leaky training corpus can lead to accidental PII outputs, which can be escalated by prompt injection in a tool-using app, and then cause downstream harm when those leaked details are used in fraud or high-stakes decisions.</p>

    <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-body">
      Treat “LLM safety” as a lifecycle program, not a single mitigation. The paper’s key managerial signal is that
      the highest-risk failures are often the result of harm chains (data → outputs → misuse → downstream), so your controls
      need both prevention and monitoring.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm panel-muted">
      <li><strong>Taxonomy first:</strong> If your team can’t name the harm class, it’s hard to measure or assign ownership.</li>
      <li><strong>Layered defenses:</strong> Red-teaming, alignment, guarded tool use, and monitoring should be stacked, not swapped.</li>
      <li><strong>Operationalize auditability:</strong> Continuous, “dynamic” audits are positioned as the practical bridge from principles to production.</li>

      <li><strong>Product & platform teams:</strong> Use the taxonomy as your risk register backbone (owners, metrics, escalation paths).</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> Treat prompts/context/tool calls as an attack surface (prompt injection, data exfiltration, poisoning).</li>

      <p class="panel-muted">Run a 2-hour cross-functional risk mapping workshop: pick one high-impact workflow (e.g., support agent, medical summarizer), label risks using the taxonomy, and for each risk write (1) a measurable indicator, (2) a mitigation layer, and (3) an “audit cadence” (pre-release, weekly, per-incident).</p>

      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Why the “lifecycle” framing matters</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">Many real failures are chains: bad training data can seed biased outputs; biased outputs can be weaponized via jailbreaks; those outputs can create downstream harms in healthcare, finance, and elections. A lifecycle taxonomy helps teams place controls at the right point in the chain (and avoid blaming the last step only).</p>

      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Severity vs prevalence (what to prioritize)</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">The paper distinguishes rare catastrophic failures from common “slow-burn” harms (e.g., everyday hallucinations, deskilling). Good programs track both: incident-style metrics for rare events and telemetry/user studies for high-prevalence issues.</p>

    <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-body">Translate the taxonomy into an operating rhythm: clear ownership, measurable indicators, layered mitigations, and an audit cadence that keeps up with model updates and evolving misuse.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm text-body">
      <li>Adopt a taxonomy-based risk register (owners, indicators, mitigations, review cadence) for every LLM-enabled workflow.</li>
      <li>Run layered defenses: red-teaming + alignment/refusal + guarded tool use + logging/monitoring (don’t rely on one layer).</li>
      <li>Separate “rare catastrophic” vs “common chronic” harms and define measurement for each (incidents vs telemetry/user studies).</li>
      <li>Plan for evolution: update eval suites and audit checks as new jailbreak tactics and new deployment contexts emerge.</li>
