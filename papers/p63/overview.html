      This paper asks a practical question: when do multi-agent LLM systems improve real task performance, and when do they just add overhead? Across 180 controlled configurations (three LLM families × five architectures × four agentic benchmarks), the authors derive measurable scaling principles that explain why coordination can help massively on decomposable tasks (e.g., finance research) yet reliably hurt on sequential, state-dependent planning.

      “More agents” is not automatically better. This paper shows multi-agent setups are great when the work can be split up and recombined (like parallel research), but they often slow you down when the work is a single tight chain of steps (like step-by-step planning).

    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm panel-muted">
      <li><strong>Use teams for parallel work:</strong> If different people could each investigate a piece and you can merge the results, agents can help a lot.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid teams for “one-thread” work:</strong> If each step depends on the last, coordination overhead can overwhelm any benefit.</li>
      <li><strong>Build in a reviewer:</strong> When you do use multiple agents, a central “checker/synthesizer” tends to be safer than just averaging independent answers.</li>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm text-body">
      <li><strong>Agent platform / infra teams:</strong> Log coordination overhead and turns; cap agent count when latency/cost rises superlinearly.</li>
      <li><strong>Product teams:</strong> Treat “multi-agent” as a design choice tied to decomposability; don’t expect it to rescue sequential workflows.</li>
      <li><strong>Evaluation owners:</strong> Prefer agentic benchmarks (multi-step interaction + partial observability) when deciding whether <em>multi-agent</em> setups help.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety / risk:</strong> Centralized verification is a simple way to reduce catastrophic error propagation versus independent ensembling.</li>

      <p class="font-semibold text-heading">Derivative example</p>
      <p class="panel-muted">Take 20 representative tasks from your production workload. Measure single-agent success, tool-call count, and whether subtasks can be solved independently. Then trial one centralized (orchestrator) and one decentralized (peer debate/vote) setup with a matched token budget, tracking overhead (% turns), time-to-solution, and error amplification.</p>

      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Agentic evaluation (vs. static benchmarks)</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">The paper defines a benchmark as “agentic” when adaptive interaction yields a meaningful advantage over any single-shot approach. This matters because multi-agent systems can look great on static tasks (where voting helps) but behave very differently when they must gather information, act through tools, and recover from mistakes over long trajectories.</p>

      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">What to measure in your traces</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">Their predictive model relies on metrics you can usually compute from logs: coordination overhead (extra turns/messages), message density, redundancy (how similar agent outputs are), and cost-normalized efficiency (success per budget). The key idea: performance is shaped by coordination dynamics, not just the nominal architecture label.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm panel-muted">
      <li><strong>Large gains on decomposable finance tasks:</strong> A centralized multi-agent setup improves Finance-Agent (a finance research benchmark) by +80.8% (0.631 vs. 0.349 single-agent).</li>
      <li><strong>Universal degradation on sequential planning:</strong> PlanCraft (a Minecraft-style step-by-step planning benchmark) degrades for every multi-agent variant (down to −70.1% for independent agents).</li>
      <li><strong>Predictive coordination model:</strong> Cross-validated R²=0.524 (MAE≈0.089) using coordination metrics, outperforming architecture labels alone.</li>
      <li><strong>Topology-dependent error amplification:</strong> Independent 17.2× vs Centralized 4.4× (Table 5).</li>
      <li><strong>Superlinear coordination growth:</strong> Turns scale roughly as (n+0.5)^1.724, creating a hard budget ceiling beyond ~3–4 agents.</li>

    <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">🔭 For your roadmap</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm text-body">
      <li>Instrument agent traces with overhead, message density, redundancy, and success-per-token; treat these as first-class KPIs.</li>
      <li>Before adding agents, measure your single-agent baseline and classify tasks by decomposability vs. sequential dependency.</li>
      <li>For high-risk outputs, prefer centralized verification (or orchestrated review) over independent ensembling.</li>
      <li>For web/navigation-style tasks, trial decentralized coordination, but cap team size and watch diminishing returns.</li>
      <li>For stateful planning pipelines, prioritize better single-agent planning/memory over multi-agent coordination.</li>
