      The paper argues that <strong>deep</strong> language understanding is more than parsing words into a form-independent meaning representation.
      Instead, to truly understand, the brain must often <strong>export</strong> what the core language system computes into other brain systems that can build
      situation models, tap memory, and construct perceptual or motor representations.

      <p class="panel-muted">Think of the language network as a fast “parser + summarizer”. For a real understanding, you often need to hand that summary to specialist teams (vision, navigation, social reasoning, memory) that can build a richer mental model.</p>

      If you care about whether a system <em>really</em> understands a sentence (instead of just producing plausible continuations), you should ask whether it
      can connect language to the right extra-linguistic machinery: mentalizing, physics, navigation, imagery, memory.
      The paper frames this as an <strong>exportation</strong> problem: core language processing is limited, so deep comprehension requires downstream systems.

      <li><strong>Shallow vs deep:</strong> the language system can build abstract, form-independent representations, but those alone need not be world-grounded.</li>

      <li><strong>Evaluation owners:</strong> add tests where success requires building a situation model (beliefs, space, physical causality), not just matching surface patterns.</li>
      <li><strong>Agent builders:</strong> if your assistant must navigate, plan, or act, treat “deep understanding” as a pipeline feature (tools, memory, perception), not a single-model guarantee.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety & policy:</strong> detect when a system is only doing shallow pattern completion (high fluency, low grounding) and route those cases to verification (retrieval, tools, or human review).</li>

      <p class="font-semibold text-heading">Derivative example</p>
      <p class="panel-muted"><strong>Customer support refunds (simple version):</strong> A customer says: “I returned the package last week, but you still charged me. Please fix this today.” A “shallow” assistant might reply with a confident apology and a generic refund promise. A “deep” assistant does two things: (1) it keeps the story straight (what happened, when, and what the customer expects), and (2) it checks the real facts before acting. In practice: look up the order, look up the carrier scan/return status, compare to the refund policy, then reply with a clear outcome (“Refund is already pending” / “We’ll issue it now” / “Return hasn’t arrived yet—here’s what we need next”) and a timeframe. If the records don’t match the customer’s story, it should ask one clarifying question or escalate.</p>

      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Shallow understanding (what it buys you)</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">The core language system can recognize linguistic forms, combine them compositionally, and produce abstract, form-independent representations (e.g., similar across paraphrases or translations). But those representations can still be insensitive to real-world plausibility, because syntax and co-occurrence alone don’t force grounding.</p>

      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">Exportation (what makes it “deep”)</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">Exportation is the idea that language-derived representations are handed off to other systems (social reasoning, navigation, physics, perception, memory) that can build richer models. The paper emphasizes how to test this rigorously: functionally specific regions, localized per person, under passive comprehension.</p>

      <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">When exportation happens (what changes it)</h3>
      <p class="text-xs panel-muted">The paper argues exportation is not automatic: it can depend on context length (long-range integration), reader traits/states/goals (topic knowledge, alertness, imagery), and how hard the linguistic form is to parse (rare words, complex constructions, proficiency).</p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm panel-muted">
      <li><strong>Theory of Mind exportation (clearest case):</strong> the paper highlights strong engagement of the rTPJ / ToM network during comprehension of mental-state content, even without explicit questions; language areas respond similarly to “mental” vs “physical” inference passages when controlling for linguistic confounds.</li>
      <li><strong>Weak plausibility constraint in core language areas:</strong> the paper notes core language areas can respond just as strongly to plausible sentences as to syntactically well-formed but nonsensical ones (e.g., “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously”), suggesting limited world-knowledge checking at this stage.</li>
      <li><strong>Action-word links to motor/perceptual systems:</strong> the paper cites classic motor-cortex effects for action words and notes a recent intracranial finding of cross-decoding from action words to videos depicting those actions.</li>

    <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold text-heading">🔭 For your roadmap</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-body">Use the exportation lens to turn “does it understand?” into concrete checks on what downstream representations your system can actually build.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-sm text-body">
      <li>Design a <strong>domain-mixed evaluation set</strong> (beliefs, space, physics, episodic recall) and measure where your pipeline breaks.</li>
      <li>When you need deep understanding, bias towards <strong>architectures with explicit externalization</strong> (tools, retrieval, memory, multimodal signals) rather than hoping a text-only model internalizes everything.</li>
      <li>Treat exportation as a <strong>mechanism question</strong>: do you route the right info to the right specialist (vs broadcasting everything)? Design evaluations that can distinguish these strategies.</li>
      <li>If you run user studies, separate <strong>fluency</strong> from <strong>grounded correctness</strong> (e.g., require users to act on the output in a constrained environment).</li>
      <li>For neuroscience-inspired measurement, follow Box 3: <strong>functionally specific regions</strong>, <strong>individual localization</strong>, and <strong>passive comprehension</strong> (don’t force imagery or Q&amp;A tasks).</li>
