## Priority 3: Variant Management & Product Data

**Status**: ‚è≥ Not Started  
**Impact**: üî• High  
**Effort**: Small (0.5 days)

### Research Finding
- **Variant chaos**: "black sneakers" returns navy, "king-size" returns Cal King

- Result volatility: Same query = different products hours apart

### Implementation

#### 3.1 Expand "Full Product Data" Implementation
- [x] **Location**: `optimizationTips.ts` - Full Data pillar
- [x] **Add to failure examples**:

**Status**: ‚è≥ Not Started  
**Impact**: üî• High  
**Effort**: Medium (1 day)

### Research Finding
- **Registration timing** kills conversions (too early = abandon)
- **Form failures** stop agents cold
- **mailto: buttons** don't work (agents can't send email)

- Confirmation page is the only human touchpoint

### Implementation

#### 4.1 Add "Agent-Friendly Conversion" Section
- [ ] **Component**: `ConversionOptimization.tsx` (new) or expand existing
- [ ] **Content**:
  - [ ] Registration strategy: Allow guest checkout, defer login until after conversion
  - [ ] Form best practices: Use `<form>` not `mailto:`, validate fields, clear errors
  - [ ] Pop-up warnings: Overlays covering CTAs = agent abandonment
  - [ ] Session length: Review logged-in duration (balance security vs re-login friction)
  - [ ] Confirmation page optimization: Cross-sells must happen HERE (agents ignore mid-funnel pop-ups)

#### 4.2 Add Interactive "Agent Conversion Test"

### Implementation

#### 5.1 Add "Tracking Agent Traffic" Section
- [ ] **Location**: New section after MetricsPanel or in LimitationsPanel
- [ ] **Content**:
  - [ ] GA4 Setup: Look for `utm_source=chatgpt.com`, filter desktop Chrome spikes

  - [ ] Test tool: "View your site in Lynx browser to see agent perspective"
  - [ ] Semantic elements: `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`
  - [ ] ARIA labels: Meaningful alt text, descriptive link text, proper heading hierarchy
  - [ ] No JS dependency: Critical content must be in HTML, not injected by JavaScript

#### 7.2 Add Code Example
