## Priority 3: Variant Management & Product Data

**Status**: ⏳ Not Started  
**Impact**: 🔥 High  
**Effort**: Small (0.5 days)

### Research Finding
- **Variant chaos**: "black sneakers" returns navy, "king-size" returns Cal King

### Implementation

#### 3.1 Expand "Full Product Data" Implementation
- [x] **Location**: `optimizationTips.ts` - Full Data pillar
- [x] **Add to failure examples**:

### Implementation

#### 4.1 Add "Agent-Friendly Conversion" Section

- [ ] **Content**:
  - [ ] Registration strategy: Allow guest checkout, defer login until after conversion
  - [ ] Form best practices: Use `<form>` not `mailto:`, validate fields, clear errors
  - [ ] Pop-up warnings: Overlays covering CTAs = agent abandonment
  - [ ] Session length: Review logged-in duration (balance security vs re-login friction)
  - [ ] Confirmation page optimization: Cross-sells must happen HERE (agents ignore mid-funnel pop-ups)

#### 4.2 Add Interactive "Agent Conversion Test"
- [ ] **Feature**: Prompt template users can copy

## Questions & Decisions Needed

### Open Questions

- [ ] Should we create separate tutorial for B2B/services vs ecommerce?
- [ ] Include actual bot log parsing code examples?

### Design Decisions
- [ ] Color scheme for Agent mode section (distinguish from Search mode)
- [ ] Icon for Agent-Readiness Checker (robot? checklist? both?)
- [ ] Layout for Industry-Specific section (cards? tabs? accordion?)
- [ ] Format for timeline graphic (horizontal scroll? vertical?)

### Technical Decisions
- [ ] Framework for interactive checklist (React state? Form library?)
- [ ] How to embed Lynx browser comparison (iframe? screenshot? link?)
- [ ] Real-time validation for Agent test prompts?
- [ ] Analytics event tracking for tutorial interactions?
