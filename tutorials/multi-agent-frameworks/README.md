# Multi-Agent Frameworks Interactive Tutorial

An interactive tutorial teaching production-grade multi-agent framework patterns: context engineering, tiered state, processor pipelines, and scoped handoffs.

## Live demo

## What you’ll learn

- Why giant prompts don’t scale (cost, latency, signal degradation)
- Context as a compiled view (storage vs presentation)
- Tiered context design (working context, session, memory, artifacts)
- Processor pipelines (observable, testable transformations)
- Scoped multi-agent handoffs (avoid context explosion)

## Local development

```bash
cd tutorials/multi-agent-frameworks
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
cd tutorials/multi-agent-frameworks
./build.sh
```
